      "he cornerstone of your retirement isn't really planning at all.Corporate Pension Plans Are Going the Way of the Hula HoopRemember hula hoops? They were all the rage back in the early 1950s among hip-swiveling young baby boomers. But within a few years, sales of these plastic novelty items fell from the millions to perhaps a few thousand a year, and today the few remaining hula hoops are little more than nostalgic relics of a more innocent era.Well, the trajectory has been similar, though not nearly as short-lived, for defined-benefit pensions. These are the types of pensions most of us think of (or used to think of) when we hear the term pensionthat is, one in which the company puts money into an investment fund and, regardless of the performance of the investments, promises to pay you a monthly check for life based on how many years you worked at the company and the size of your salary. Often, after putting in twenty-five or more years at a company, retirees could walk away with pension benefits that guaranteed them upward of half of their salary.As these types of pension plans were nearing their peak in the late twentieth century, the seeds for their demise were being sewn. For one thing, companies began to realize that with this type of pension they could be on the hook for much bigger liabilities than they'd expected. After all, with more and more people living well into their nineties or even hitting the century mark, companies could end up making monthly payments for thirty or forty years, if not longer, to retirees who stubbornly refused to die. Many companies began to decide they were better off shutting down their defined-benefit plans or at least not starting any new ones. As a result, the number of company-funded pensions fell from 114,000 in 1985 to about 31,000 today, a drop of more than 70 percent.The old pension arrangement where the company funded the plan and you were guaranteed a monthly check for life is rapidly becoming a vestige of a near-obsolete system. If you are lucky enough to work for a company that still provides such a plan, that's great. But that's not the case for most of us, which means that for the majority of Americans that second leg of the retirement stool has gotten a lot shorter.More than Ever Before, the Onus Is on Us to Save and Invest for Our Own RetirementWith the first two legs of that three-legged retirement stool contributing less to our retirement security than in the past, we now have to rely more than ever before on that third leg: personal savings.Fortunately, even as traditional defined-benefit pension plans have been disappearing, most of us have had access to a growing array of other types of retirement savings plans. At the top of the list are defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s, which allow you to contribute a percentage of your salary before taxes into a variety of investments, typically mutual funds. In many cases, employers will match a portion of what you put into the plan. These are called defined-contribution plans because in accordance with federal pension law the plan stipulates, or defines, how much you can contribute to the plan. No guarantees are made about the benefits the plan will pay, however. Which makes these plans the mirror image in a sense of the defined-benefit plans discussed above, where it was the benefit payment that was defined, while the employers' contribution could change depending on the performance of the plan's investment assets.401(k)s and other types of plans require us to take on a much bigger role than ever before in planning for retirement in two specific and crucial ways.First, you've got to take the initiative to put your money into these plans. If you contribute only a small percentage of your salary to your 401(k) plan, then you will have only a little bit of money at work for your retirement. If you don't contribute any of your salary, then the plan is absolutely no help to you at all. Even in the cases where the employer is willing to kick in some contributions to the plan, those contributions are matching contributions.Those who are willing to stash away money in these plans, however, got a big break in a piece of legislation known as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, or more simply the 2001 tax bill. In addition to phasing in cuts in marginal income tax ...\n",

      "product/description: Let's start with the good news--Turok 2: Seeds of Evil throws hordes of superbly animated evil mutants and overevolved dinosaurs into the range of an arsenal that makes other games' weapon collections look like lonely baseball bats hanging on a beat-up pickup truck's rifle rack. Start with a battle-claw for hand-to-hand combat and a bow and arrow for longer shots, then move up to plasma rifles and a heat-seeking missile launcher. Since you can't fire heat-seeking missiles underwater, Turok 2 has specialized SEAL-style weapons, such as a harpoon gun and concussion torpedoes. When mere human-sized weapons aren't enough, saddle up on the back of a friendly dinosaur and charge into battle, firing a dino-mounted 20mm cannon. Want more good news? OK. Unlike many first-person shooter games, Turok 2 provides its bad guys with decent artificial intelligence. You may have to dodge mutants working together to set up a crossfire, or run down enemies who are too smart to just step in front of your weapons. And while you're shooting all the evil monsters and tracking down cowards who flee from your big guns, you'll enjoy well-rendered scenery from five different worlds. If this sounds great to you, and you enjoy exploring strange alien environments and shooting nearly everything that moves, you'll enjoy Turok 2. But there are some problems that might prevent you from enjoying it completely. The biggest annoyance is that the game's excellent artificial intelligence isn't matched by intelligent-level design. This is one of those games that requires you to search every corner to find the key you need to unlock the door on the other side of the honeycomb of tunnels. You'll need to use the game's mapping tools to make sure you've looked behind each big door for the small clues and behind each small barrel for the big clues. If you're a master of the Zen of Just-Wandering-Around, Turok 2 won't bother you; but if you're the type of gamer who wants to feel a sense of urgency or a sense that your actions are meshing with a larger story, you may end up tapping your fingers and thinking about other challenges. --Rob Heinsoo  Pros:  Diverse arsenal of powerful and original weapons Great monster animation and monster death-throes Smart monsters who run away and team up against you Decent multiplayer game  Cons:  Inconsistent-level design No sense of urgency\tThis software is BRAND NEW.

Will the hero realize that that sound he heard all those years ago was his meddling future self? The most successful stories toy with genre conventions or use time travel as a device in support of bigger concerns. James P. Hogan\\'s slyly amusing \"Convolution\" focuses on time-machine inventor Professor Abercrombie. The professor loses his notes before completing his machine, but a future version of himself sends a time machine back, embroiling Abercrombie in a neatly dovetailed succession of weird cross-time commutes. In Nina Kiriki Hoffman\\'s amusing \"Mint Condition,\" time travel takes a backseat to time-traveler Sissy\\'s realization that her bosses are playing her for a fool. Family-centered stories include Jody Lynn Nye\\'s light \"Theory of Relativity,\" in which Rachel recruits another version of herself and tracks down their grandfather; Peter Crowther\\'s emotionally fraught \"Things I Didn\\'t Know My Father Knew,\" about a man\\'s opportunity to see his dead father; and Gary A. Braunbeck\\'s touching \"Palimpsest Day,\" wherein a man has the chance to change his life by intervening at one moment in his past. Newcomers to the genre will find many stories engaging, but too few of these entries question the clichs they perpetuate. (Oct. 9)Forecast: A cover featuring a warped clock and a cartoon-like air vehicle will appeal to young readers more than  to SF aficionados, and won\\'t do much to boost sales.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\\tThe authors of these new stories on the classic sf trope of time travel let it lead them as it may through genres including mystery, romance, space opera, and quiet reflection at home. The book\\'s selections are excellent, which isn\\'t surprising given the likes of Nina Kiriki Hoffman, Jody Lynn Nye, and James P. Hogan as contributors and the fact that lesser-knowns proffer fine stories, too. Altogether, they take us to both the future and the past. William H. Keith Jr.\\'s \"Iterations\" goes so far into the future that it is nearly incomprehensible, and Kathleen Massie-Ferch\\'s \"A Touch through Time\" begins with a scientist in love with a woman who has been dead for nearly a century. Sometimes, even the past travels, and in Peter Crowther\\'s \"Things I Didn\\'t Know My Father Knew,\" fog brings more than low visibility.

YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMOREIt's one of the greatest moments in one of the greatest movies of all time, The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, has just been transported along with her little terrier, Toto, from the Kansas farm where she lives with her auntie Em and uncle Henry to a mysterious place called Oz. The flat, monotone Kansas prairie has been replaced by a bizarre landscape bursting with color and lush with exotic flowers and plants. Bedazzled, Dorothy looks around, trying to gain her bearings in this unfamiliar terrain. And then she utters those famous words to her little dog: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.When it comes to describing the situation most of us face today when planning for retirement, I can hardly think of a better line: You're not in Kansas anymore. The old, familiar landscape we once took for granted, the cozy, secure world where you could count on the combination of government largesse and an employer-funded pension to provide you with a comfy retirement, has given way to a totally new environment, one as alien to the world we knew before as Oz is to Kansas.Granted, in this new retirement world we don't have to deal with such nasty creatures as the Wicked Witch of the West or her army of freaky flying monkeys, as Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion did. But the twenty-first-century retirement-planning landscape is nonetheless teeming with daunting challenges of a different breed. We must learn how to get the most out of financial instruments that retirees a generation ago never had to concern themselves with, an alphanumeric soup of 401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457 plans, IRAs, Keoghs, SEPs, and so on. (IRAs, Keoghs, and SEPs, oh my!) And then there are the myriad rules concerning IRA rollovers, early withdrawal penalties, borrowing regulations, and RMDs (required minimum distributions). On top of all this, we've got to invest our retirement savings and thus learn to navigate the often treacherous waters of the financial markets, where sudden setbacks can sometimes undo years of diligent saving. In short, just as Dorothy had to familiarize herself with the strange ways of Oz in order to find her way back home, so too must we develop retirement-planning strategies that offer the best chance of success given the new realities we face.In this chapter I'll bring you up to speed on the new retirement landscape, including a number of distinctly positive developments stemming from recent changes in the tax laws that can increase our chances of achieving a comfortable retirement. Only by coming to grips with the various changes that have transformed the world of retirement planning and understanding how those changes affect you can you sensibly plan for your own retirement.Changes in the Financial Aspects of RetirementSocial Security Ain't What It Used to BeTraditionally, retirement-planning experts have told us to think of our income sources during retirement as a three-legged stool, the first leg being Social Security, the second company-funded pensions, and the third personal savings. In fact, however, this stool would have been pretty lopsided because for most people the role of that first leg, Social Security, was much, much bigger than the other two.But today's and future generations of retirees aren't going to get anything remotely approaching the kind of windfall Social Security recipients received in years past. For one thing, there aren't enough workers paying into the system to provide benefits comparable to those past generations received. You don't have to be a financial whiz to figure out that fewer people putting money into the system and more drawing it out spells trouble. And that, according to the Social Security Administration's own projections, is exactly what lies ahead. Given the uncertain outlook for this program, some financial planners suggest that people filling out retirement-planning worksheets put a big fat zero on the line where you enter your expected Social Security benefit. I think that's a little extreme. Even if the Social Security trustees' projections are accurate and the trust fund runs dry in 2042 or so, it's not as if the Social Security system will go bankrupt then, as is often suggested in the press. Payroll and income taxes will continue to flow into the system as before. Those taxes just won't be enough to pay full benefits, but they would be able to pay between 65 and 73 percent of currently scheduled benefits over the subsequent thirty-five years.It's anyone's guess how this will be resolved. At some point in the future the Social Security system could include some version of individual accounts that would allow us to put a portion of our Social Security taxes into stock and bond mutual fund accounts instead of having the money invested solely in U.S. Treasury bonds, as is now the case. That might help some of us earn a higher rate of return on the money we put into the plan and possibly boost what we collect in benefits down the road. Or Congress might try to shore up the existing system by raising payroll taxes or tinkering in other ways. Or maybe we'll see a combination of both approaches. Whatever is done, however, I would expect that future Social Security benefits will be smaller than they've been in the past. If you are relying primarily on Social Security to carry you through retirement, you are (a) counting on a very short retirement, (b) counting on a very grim retirement, (c) fooling yourself, or (d) all of the above. Suffice it to say that planning to make Social Security the cornerstone of your retirement isn't really planning at all.Corporate Pension Plans Are Going the Way of the Hula HoopRemember hula hoops? They were all the rage back in the early 1950s among hip-swiveling young baby boomers. But within a few years, sales of these plastic novelty items fell from the millions to perhaps a few thousand a year, and today the few remaining hula hoops are little more than nostalgic relics of a more innocent era.Well, the trajectory has been similar, though not nearly as short-lived, for defined-benefit pensions. These are the types of pensions most of us think of (or used to think of) when we hear the term pensionthat is, one in which the company puts money into an investment fund and, regardless of the performance of the investments, promises to pay you a monthly check for life based on how many years you worked at the company and the size of your salary. Often, after putting in twenty-five or more years at a company, retirees could walk away with pension benefits that guaranteed them upward of half of their salary.As these types of pension plans were nearing their peak in the late twentieth century, the seeds for their demise were being sewn. For one thing, companies began to realize that with this type of pension they could be on the hook for much bigger liabilities than they'd expected. After all, with more and more people living well into their nineties or even hitting the century mark, companies could end up making monthly payments for thirty or forty years, if not longer, to retirees who stubbornly refused to die. Many companies began to decide they were better off shutting down their defined-benefit plans or at least not starting any new ones. As a result, the number of company-funded pensions fell from 114,000 in 1985 to about 31,000 today, a drop of more than 70 percent.The old pension arrangement where the company funded the plan and you were guaranteed a monthly check for life is rapidly becoming a vestige of a near-obsolete system. If you are lucky enough to work for a company that still provides such a plan, that's great. But that's not the case for most of us, which means that for the majority of Americans that second leg of the retirement stool has gotten a lot shorter.More than Ever Before, the Onus Is on Us to Save and Invest for Our Own RetirementWith the first two legs of that three-legged retirement stool contributing less to our retirement security than in the past, we now have to rely more than ever before on that third leg: personal savings.Fortunately, even as traditional defined-benefit pension plans have been disappearing, most of us have had access to a growing array of other types of retirement savings plans. At the top of the list are defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s, which allow you to contribute a percentage of your salary before taxes into a variety of investments, typically mutual funds. In many cases, employers will match a portion of what you put into the plan. These are called defined-contribution plans because in accordance with federal pension law the plan stipulates, or defines, how much you can contribute to the plan. No guarantees are made about the benefits the plan will pay, however. Which makes these plans the mirror image in a sense of the defined-benefit plans discussed above, where it was the benefit payment that was defined, while the employers' contribution could change depending on the performance of the plan's investment assets.401(k)s and other types of plans require us to take on a much bigger role than ever before in planning for retirement in two specific and crucial ways.First, you've got to take the initiative to put your money into these plans. If you contribute only a small percentage of your salary to your 401(k) plan, then you will have only a little bit of money at work for your retirement. If you don't contribute any of your salary, then the plan is absolutely no help to you at all. Even in the cases where the employer is willing to kick in some contributions to the plan, those contributions are matching contributions.Those who are willing to stash away money in these plans, however, got a big break in a piece of legislation known as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, or more simply the 2001 tax bill. In addition to phasing in cuts in marginal income tax ...\",\n",

Start with a battle-claw for hand-to-hand combat and a bow and arrow for longer shots, then move up to plasma rifles and a heat-seeking missile launcher. Since you can't fire heat-seeking missiles underwater, Turok 2 has specialized SEAL-style weapons, such as a harpoon gun and concussion torpedoes. When mere human-sized weapons aren't enough, saddle up on the back of a friendly dinosaur and charge into battle, firing a dino-mounted 20mm cannon. Want more good news? OK. Unlike many first-person shooter games, Turok 2 provides its bad guys with decent artificial intelligence. You may have to dodge mutants working together to set up a crossfire, or run down enemies who are too smart to just step in front of your weapons. And while you're shooting all the evil monsters and tracking down cowards who flee from your big guns, you'll enjoy well-rendered scenery from five different worlds. If this sounds great to you, and you enjoy exploring strange alien environments and shooting nearly everything that moves, you'll enjoy Turok 2. But there are some problems that might prevent you from enjoying it completely. The biggest annoyance is that the game's excellent artificial intelligence isn't matched by intelligent-level design. This is one of those games that requires you to search every corner to find the key you need to unlock the door on the other side of the honeycomb of tunnels. You'll need to use the game's mapping tools to make sure you've looked behind each big door for the small clues and behind each small barrel for the big clues. If you're a master of the Zen of Just-Wandering-Around, Turok 2 won't bother you; but if you're the type of gamer who wants to feel a sense of urgency or a sense that your actions are meshing with a larger story, you may end up tapping your fingers and thinking about other challenges. --Rob Heinsoo  Pros:  Diverse arsenal of powerful and original weapons Great monster animation and monster death-throes Smart monsters who run away and team up against you Decent multiplayer game  Cons:  Inconsistent-level design No sense of urgency\\tThis software is BRAND NEW.

A poet\\'s poet, Carruth spins simple lines full of possible meanings, lines that stick in the reader\\'s mind a long time. In \"Particularity,\" for instance, Carruth writes of \"this invisible / hereness where I am . . . the center / of mystery.\" Juxtaposing the mysterious with the tangible, Carruth is writing better than ever.\\tCarruth\\'s latest collection revolves around a handful of familiar themes, all of which mingle and reconfigure throughout the poet\\'s bittersweet, sometimes celebratory, occasionally rueful verse. Meditations on aging and love, nostalgia and guilt, contemporary politics and ancient history filter through much of this generally moving, uneven collection. Carruth\\'s voice, always highly personal, is at its best when it mixes colloquial diction with an elegiac lyricism, as in his meditation on family history, \"Flying into St. Louis\": \"For sixty-five years/ I\\'ve blamed my mother and father,/ I\\'ve climbed their trees and lopped off/ their branches, I\\'ve held/ their words in my mind like cudgels.\" At other times, however, the colloquial takes over and Carruth\\'s verse becomes almost flat, as in \"The Chain\": \"but I am a poet and you are too and so are all people/ except the monsters of this world/ out there planting/ mines in the mud and snow....\" Despite its lesser offerings, the collection amply illustrates the openness and honesty with which Carruth addresses the world, the mixed compassion and outrage with which he responds to it and his continued productivity through a long, distinguished career. Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tAlthough Carruth here declares \"Truth and Beauty/ were never the/ aims of proper poetry,\" there\\'s plenty of both in this affecting volume. \"When we say I/ miss you/ what we mean is \"I\\'m/ filled with/ dread\"; \"Was it the way of your world, too, old master, that everyone had to be/ a villain in someone else\\'s life?\"; \"This is the summer of war in Bosnia./ A few summers ago the war was somewhere else.\" Carruth drops such aphoristic insights with ease, and they hit like gentle little blows alerting us to what is at the heart of our experience. Every line is perfectly polished?not \"crafted,\" which seems far too deliberate and forced a word for this easy-flowing poetry, but smoothed as if the words had been rolled around and around the tongue like good whiskey (and maybe even scrambled eggs). These poems, all written since the publication of Collected Shorter Poems, 1946-1991 (LJ 4/1/92), which won the National Book Award, demonstrate that Carruth is still at the top of his form. Recommended for all poetry collections.?Barbara Hoffert, \"Library Journal\"Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tCarruth has often pondered the icon that is Robert Frost--the old poet wryly at odds with his country and thereby embodying its favorite self-image. Now he is old enough to be the Frost of his generation; he is just that when he spins a lilting, metrically exact, carefully rhymed \"Homage to Edwin Muir\" or fires off a slangy couplet on \"The Last Poem in the World\" : \"Would I write it if I could? / Bet your glitzy ass I would.\" Yet he is very much of his generation--poets for whom Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams were more influential than Frost. He shares Pound\\'s love of the classical Chinese masters, expressing it here in the sequence \"A Summer with Tu Fu\" ; another sequence he imagines as \"Faxes to William,\" and there are echoes of Williams throughout this book. Other generational passions Carruth upholds are a fierce antiwar stance and existentialism; he often uses them for satiric seasoning. Finally, there is personal passion here, for \"I am in love now, / In it totally all the time. / I have nothing else, I have forgotten my name . . .\" Contemporary American poetry doesn\\'t get any richer than this.

       " '0060167769': \"Reading this, one feels like an urban explorer walking a few paces behind the author, agog at the mystery and magic of New York City's Chinatown. Doors open. Faces appear and recede. At the end of the dazzling journey in which a low faan (barbarian or white person) finds unusual access to backrooms, tongs (secret societies), family associations, gong si fongs (bachelor apartments), herbalists, family histories, hopes and dreams, Chinatown retains its elusive character. Kinkead, a New Yorker contributor, vividly relates her various guides' accounts, told sometimes in broken English or in the snappy police lingo used by detectives to describe tong and drug activity. The variety, poverty, resilience and frenzy of Chinatown and its residents are brilliantly described, from a Chinatown apartment where an old woman immobilized by bound feet looks out a window to a late-night gathering of chefs swapping recipes. Take the tour. Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tJournalist Kinkead presents a stilted account that highlights the seamier side of New York City's Chinatown. She takes the reader on a rambling tour of gambling, drug lords, extortion, murder, racial hatred, and intergenerational clashes yet makes little attempt to cover any of the more positive and life-enhancing aspects of Chinese family support, religion, or education in this society. She also draws no conclusions about the society. This is mostly due to Kinkead's New Yorker style of anecdotal reporting; not surprising, since she is a frequent contributor to the magazine. This book is little more than an armchair Chinatown travelog, offering the excitement and titillation of foreign vice in an alien landscape. Kinkead is at least honest in making no pretense that this is a balanced, scholarly, sociological investigation. Optional.- Glenn Masuchika, Chaminade Univ. Lib., HonoluluCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tKinkead, a frequent New Yorker contributor, boldly knocks at the bamboo curtain shielding New York's Chinatown, until it lifts a bit--revealing a community so exotic as to be ``virtually a nation unto itself.'' To nearly all the Chinese whom Kinkead meets in Chinatown, she is a low faan (``barbarian'')--``an object of fear, distrust, indifference.'' Yet, with the help of a Hong Kong-born translator, she slowly gains the confidence of waiters, shopkeepers, restaurateurs, healers, and so on, drawing on their stories, as well as on scholarly research, to piece together this personable look at ``the largest Chinese community in the Western hemisphere.'' No mean feat, that: typical is the author's exploration of a dark alley leading to a decrepit tenement where she meets a withered ancient who says that Kinkead is the first white person he's spoken to in 60 years in Chinatown. What keeps 150,000 Chinese in this isolated, crowded, crumbling ``slum''? Ironically, Kinkead finds, it's basically the urge to get out- -fulfilled through the single-minded accumulation of wealth. While Kinkead talks to men who work 80-hour weeks at menial jobs, live in dire poverty, and save a small fortune each year, her report makes it clear that the engine that drives Chinatown's economy is crime, festering in sweatshops and gambling halls, thriving on extortion and drug-dealing. Kinkead's too much of an outsider to penetrate the tongs and gangs that control Chinatown crime, but she offers comprehensive briefs on them, vivified by a tour of the mean streets with a veteran cop. But there's a gentler side, too, to Chinatown, and Kinkead covers that as well--family ties, festivals, Chinese medicine and cuisine, the tradition of concubinage, and the burgeoning urges to assimilate and to bring democracy to the Chinese mainland. Told in strong, clean prose: an exotic and fascinating journey by a modern-day, urban Marco Polo. (Eight pages of b photographs- -not seen.) -- Copyright 1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

       " '1845960793': 'Starred Review. This harrowing, turbocharged account of undercover life is reminiscent of Joseph D. Pistone\\'s Donnie Brasco. After military service in Vietnam, Queen began his law enforcement career, eventually spending 20 years as an ATF special agent. In 1998, through contact with a \"confidential informant,\" he began to hang with the Mongol Nation, a violent Southern California motorcycle club (\"a tight-knit collective of crazies, unpredictable and unrepentant badasses\") with 20 chapters in several states and 350 members both in and out of prison. Assuming the role of bearded biker \"Billy St. John,\" Queen entered into a 28-month undercover operation. To gather evidence of homicide, weapons and narcotics violations, he sometimes wore a wire, knowing that its discovery could lead to his murder. Indeed, he was suspected at first of being a cop and forced to prove himself in more than a few dangerous situations. But after months of hazing, he became a trusted member. Queen steers clear of melodrama and captures both sides of his double life; the sadistic characters and criminal camaraderie are contrasted with his own inner turmoil, as he thought of the Mongols as his friends while the investigation escalated. The strength and white-hot intensity of the writing make this read like a movie, and Hollywood is certain to take note. 16 pages of bw photos not seen by PW.

All rights reserved.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tQueen risked his life when he joined the Mongols as bearded biker Billy St. John. His adventures with one of Americas most notorious bike gangs, where he explains \"murder and mayhem have become simply a lifestyle choice,\" resulted in the convictions of more than 50 Mongols and earned him an impressive cache of awards. More important, after harrowing trials that included selling drugs to driving getaway cars, Queen lived to tell all about it. Queen recounts these two years with a straightforward gruffness that captivated critics. His story is tight, suspenseful, and unstoppableyou know hes going to bust the men who became like brothers to him, but its just a matter of when and how. The movie version starring Mel Gibson is slated for 2006.Copyright  2004 Phillips  Nelson Media, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tQueen infiltrated the notorious California motorcycle gang the Mongols for two years (1998-2000) and recalls the experience in an account remarkable not only for its cliff-hanging moments but also for the perceptive observations of gangster culture. Mongols are lethally loyal to their own, with an interior hierarchy ascended by passing various tests. Deadly situations abounded for Queen, a special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and while he didn\\'t have to carry through on a group expectation to stab a Mongol enemy, he projected a pugilistic allegiance that earned him the club\\'s trust and its coveted patch, which proclaimed him a true Mongol brother. The psychological stress of living the deception (including witnessing the abuse and sexual degradation of women) was compounded by acting the Mongol part for uniformed police who pulled him over. Ratcheted up by foreknowledge that Queen would eventually betray the Mongols, some of whom he regarded as genuine friends, the narrative is unstoppable. A word-of-mouth sleeper.

I  smelled that thick mix of Budweiser and crank-fueled sleeplessness on  his breath. The words he spat felt hotter than the midday Southern  California sun. He cocked his head to one side and pushed closer. Im  askin you a fuckin question, Billy!Red Dog, the national sergeant at arms of the Mongols Motorcycle Club,  stood six feet tall, with long, stringy hair and a rust-colored  handlebar mustache that drooped below his chin. From his pierced  forehead, a silver chain swept down ominously past his left eye. His  powerfully muscled arms were sleeved out with a web of prison tattoos,  and his right hand clutched a loaded 9-mm Glock semiautomatic. Behind  him, six other MongolsEvel, C.J., Domingo, Diablo, Bobby Loco, and  Luciferall in various states of drunkenness and methamphetamine highs,  were slapping magazines into their Glocks and Berettas. More than one  had his Mongol colors decorated with the skull-and-crossbones patch,  boldly announcing to the world that he had killed for the club.Here at the end of a long dirt road, in an abandoned orange grove a 180  miles north of Los Angeles, what had begun as a typical Southern  California daythat perfect golden sun beating down on a ribbon of  black highwayhad quickly turned into my worst nightmare.For several months now, working deep undercover on assignment for the  Department of the Treasurys Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  (ATF), Id been posing as a Mongols prospecta probationary member of  the club, a position that allowed me to wear my black leather vest with  the lower rocker reading california but not yet the official  black-and-white center patch and top rocker that distinguished a  full-fledged member.As a prospect, youre a slave, the property of the club. You have to do  everything a member tells you to do, from hauling drugs and guns to  wiping a members ass if he orders you to. Some members were good for  simple orders like Prospect, go get me a beer, or Light my  cigarette, or Clean my bike. But other members, guys like Red Dog,  took inordinate pleasure in making a prospects life a living hell.Prospecting inside the Mongols was a dangerous game. According to intel  developed by ATF, the Mongols Motorcycle Club had assumed the mantle of  the most violent motorcycle gang in America, a tight-knit collective of  crazies, unpredictable and unrepentant badasses. With 350 full-patch  members, the gang was a small fraction of the size of the Hells Angels,  their hated rivals, but the Mongols had wreaked more than their fair  share of havoc since they were founded in the early seventies.Their most significant violent acts in the 1970s and 80s were  committed against the Angels, with whom they fought (and ultimately  won) a seventeen-year war. But by the mid-nineties, infused by the  ruthless Latino gang mentality of East Los Angeles, the Mongols  indiscriminate violence spread outside the biker underworld and began  to terrorize the general populace of Southern California. When the  Mongols frequented mainstream bars and clubs, where people were not as  familiar with the gangs fearsome reputation, the result was a series  of vicious assaults, stabbings, and gunfights. In late 1997 the Mongols  got into a confrontation in a club in the San Gabriel Valley, just  outside of L.A., which resulted in a shoot-out, leaving one man dead.  Also in 1997, the Mongols went to two nightclubs in the Los Angeles  area and stabbed patrons in plain view of dozens of witnesses, but no  one would come forward to testify against them.Nor was the Mongols violence limited to the outside world; even within  the ranks of the club, the gang had such a reputation for assaulting  its prospects that by the late nineties, the membership was dwindling:  No one wanted to join a club if it meant that every day and night he  had to worry about taking a savage beat-down. In 1998 they adopted a  new national policy: No beating on the prospects. And almost everyone  stuck by it, except for Red Dog.Despite the fact that as national sergeant at arms he was supposed to  be enforcing the clubs rules and constitutionyes, the club had a  seventy-page constitutionRed Dog was a loose cannon, riding his Harley  through life with a fuck everyone attitude. For months he was in my  face, smashing his heavy fist into my chest, at times uppercutting me  as hard as he could. More than once hed sucker-punched me in the gut,  leaving me doubled over, gasping for air, and ready to puke. But I was  a prospect, so I gritted my teeth and sucked it up.That morning we had all hooked up at C.J.s house, where the dudes  drank hard and I did my prospect thing, fetching beer for the patches  (as fully inducted members of the club are called), lighting their  cigarettes, watching them do line after line of crank and coke. Then  when Red Dog figured everyone was drunk and high enough, he gave an  abrupt order: Lets go shoot.This was a Mongols membership requirement: Before any prospect could  attain full-patch status in the club, he had to prove that he owned a  firearm and was a decent shot. When I got behind the wheel of my  bullet-pocked red Mustang, I thought we were heading out to an actual  firing rangeand so did my ATF backup. We formed a ragged convoy behind  Red Dogs burgundy Monte Carlo as we left the Visalia city limits. I  kept glancing in my rearview mirror, checking to see that my backup was  still there. But as we got farther and farther into the countryside of  vineyards and orange groves, eventually turning down a remote dirt  driveway, I realized we had completely lost my backup. I also realized  this wasnt going to be a standard firearms-qualification exercise.  There was nothing ATF could do to help me now. If shit went bad, it  just went bad. I was alone.Now, with a collection of new semiautomatic pistols on the hoods of our  cars and the loaded magazines clicking into place, the mood in the  orange grove suddenly turned dark and twisted. One Mongol brother stood  loading rounds into a street-sweeper, a high-capacity, drum-fed  semiautomatic 12-gauge shotgun that looks similar to the old Thompson  submachine gun from the Prohibition era. An awesome assault weapon,  beloved by drug dealers and hard-core gangsters, the street-sweeper has  since been banned by the feds. I knew that a gun like that was useless  for target shooting; like the tommy gun, a street-sweeper is a pure  killing machine.Without warning, Red Dog was up in my face again, head cocked to one  side, hollering crazilyaccusing me of being an undercover cop. How  long was your fuckin academy, Billy?What are you talkin about, Red Dog?You know what Im talking about, Billy! Who the fuck did you tell you  was comin up here? Who the fuck did you tell you was gonna be with the  Mongols today? Who, Billy?I didnt tell nobody. Come on, Red, why you acting like this? I didnt  tell nobody I was coming up to Visalia.He locked his slate blue eyes on mine and, in torturous silence, stared  at me for fifteen seconds. So youre saying if I put a bullet in the  back of your fuckin head right now, aint nobody gonna know where to  start looking for you? Is that right, Billy?Yeah, I guess thats right, Red Dog.He gestured across the dusty, desolate, trash-strewn field, told me to  go set up some cans to shoot at. My first thought was of the infamous  1963 Onion Field case, chronicled in Joseph Wambaughs bestseller and  subsequent movie, in which two young LAPD officers, after stopping a  vehicle in Hollywood they suspected had been involved in a series of  armed robberies, were kidnapped by a pair of ex-convicts and taken to a  remote onion field outside Bakersfield. Officer Ian Campbell was shot  dead while Officer Karl Hettinger watched in horror before escaping  with his life.When I turned my back to Red Dog and the other armed Mongols, the icy  realization hit me: After the firefights in Vietnam, after twenty-five  years in law enforcement, this was the way it endedI was going to die  on a gorgeous Southern California day, by a Mongol bullet, in the  middle of a godforsaken, abandoned orange grove somewhere outside  Visalia.I closed my eyes and began to walk, waiting for the bullets to start  tearing through my back. I couldnt even turn to shoot it out: Red Dog  and Domingo had made certain that I was the only one without a gun. It  was a simple equation: If theyd made me, I was going to die today. I  stumbled across the field in my motorcycle boots and suddenly saw an  image of my two sons standing tearfully over my open casket. Id felt  similar eerie premonitions during my tour of duty in Vietnam, but here,  without question, there was nothing worth dying for.Suddenly, I heard a loud pop and felt my boot crunching an empty beer  can. My knees buckled, but I bent down and picked up the can. I glanced  back toward the Mongols and saw them talking in a tight circle instead  of pointing their guns and training their sights on me. No, they  werent going to shoot me, at least not right now . . .From the Hardcover edition.\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMass Market Paperback\\t edition.\\tATF Special Agent William Queen\\'s true story of infiltrating and busting the country\\'s most feared biker gang, the Mongols, is delivered with leathery confidence by Don Leslie.

The urgent need to discover deeper feminine values and to challenge the rigid and possessive qualities of patriarchy belongs to the psychology of all of us.-- Suzanne Wagner, Ph.D., Jungian AnalystProducer of A Matter of HeartA moving exploration of the feminine journey from father\\'s daughter to peer. Murdock guides us through uncharted territory to find, within the shadow of our fathers\\' influence, a female vision that is powerful and nurturing. Groundbreaking and dynamic, Fathers\\' Daughters invites us not only to heal the father-daughter wounds, but also to build our own distinctly feminine futures.-- Brenda Peterson, Author of Nature and Other Mothers\\tThe most complex and unexplored relationship in a woman\\'s life is with her father. If their bond is close, she is referred to as \"Daddy\\'s little girl.\" As cute as that may sound in childhood, a \"father\\'s daughter\" later pays a high price for her favored status. In order to sustain his approval, protection, and love, she often distances herself from her mother and rejects her own feminine nature. By identifying solely with her father, her development as a woman is arrested in daughterhood.In this unique and fascinating look at a pervasive personal and cultural issue, family therapist Maureen Murdock at last reveals the unspoken truth about daughters and the immense power the fathers they idealize have over them. Fathers\\' Daughters explores how these exclusive relationships affect every aspect of a woman\\'s life. While fathers\\' daughters are often high achievers in the outside world, their denial of their innate feminine nature wreaks havoc on other aspects of their lives -- from fearing commitment to recklessly choosing a mate, among a host of other personal and professional problems.With revealing case studies and an exploration of the hidden truth in myths, dreams, and fairy tales, Fathers\\' Daughters makes a clear that the rewards for healing the father-daughter relationship are great -- as a woman will learn to take herself seriously, reclaim the authority she projects onto men, and establish a healthy, balanced sense of herself as a woman.\\tMAUREEN MURDOCK is a psychotherapist and a writing teacher, as well as the author of The Heroine\\'s Journey: Woman\\'s Quest for Wholeness.

If you are blessed with multiple dogs you\\'ll want to own this book.\\t... the author helps you decode canine body language - a must if you\\'re to grasp the species\\' behavior and moods and assume the leadership role. -- Ranny Green, Seattle Times\\tTo get the information needed to write this book, the author sent a Letter-to-the-Editor to both Dog Fancy and Dog World magazines, asking people who lived with more than one dog to share information with her by sending for a questionnaire. The response was incredible, and the amount of information she received was overwhelming. She mailed out 1052 questionnaires and received 928 of them back!  Combining her own experience of living with five dogs with the information received from across the country, as well as internationally, the author wrote this book on the topics that most directly impact a multiple dog household. A sampling of covered topics include:  Pack Behavior Introducing a Dog into a Multiple Dog Household Manners in a Multiple Dog Setting Feeding Solutions Vacationing and Traveling Group Health  Adding to the overall appeal of this book, the illustrator, Susan Weir, does an outstanding job of portraying particular points in some of the most humorous drawings you will find.\\tIt is my involvement with dogs and their families that made this book possible. You only need to walk into an animal shelter or even know people who are aware that you are a \"dog person\" to become involved with dogs that need homes.

All dogs large and small alike, probably evolved from the wolf.  The wolf pack hierarchy is what you must deal with when you own more than one dog. As L. David Mech states in his book, The Way of the Wolf: \"Wolves are not just wild dogs. Rather, dogs are domesticated wolves. Wolf behavior has been shaped and molded to make an animal that is more tractable and trainable and easier for humans to live with - to make the dog. In this respect, the dog is essentially a juvenile wolf, dependent on and dominated by its owners who play the role of parents and older pack mates. Nevertheless, the basics of behavior are the same for both animals.\"   The following is from Chapter 4:  Cathy has four female dogs, one Yorkshire Terrier (Bebop), and three Papillons (Emily, Katie, and Sophie). The food is left down all the time, but it seems they only eat when Cathy is at home. Her problem was Bebop. She was guarding the food so Cathy put down two bowls of food. This did not seem to solve the problem so she tried putting down fifteen bowls of food. Since Bebop could not guard all of the dishes, she now just guards the bowl she is eating from and the other dogs can enjoy their food.',\n",
       " '031228117X': 'With clarity, insight, and thoroughness, Abraham, a reporter for  Toronto\\'s Globe and Mail, tactfully sets the record straight  regarding the people and events surrounding the notorious  removal of Albert Einstein\\'s brain after his 1955 autopsy and  its history over the next 40 years. While she pays particular  attention to Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who removed  Einstein\\'s brain and preserved it in a Tupperware container,  Abraham does not overlook numerous other significant  participants in this odd tale (e.g., Otto Nathan, one of  Einstein\\'s executors), nor does she exclude the significant  scientists and doctors to whom Harvey offered pieces of the  brain for research over the years. Included as well are  pertinent details about Einstein and, more importantly,  information about brain research as it evolved over the 40 years  that Harvey was the brain\\'s caretaker. Unlike Michael  Paterniti\\'s Driving Mr. Albert (LJ 7/00), a superficial travel  piece with its author and Harvey motoring cross-country with  several pieces of Einstein\\'s brain in the luggage, Abraham\\'s  carefully reported account reveals the real who, what, when,  why, and where of an event that has become almost mythological.  Her 23-page \"Sources\" section documents the research. An  enjoyable read, this is highly recommended for all  collections. Michael D. Cramer, Raleigh, NC    Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tLike a holy relic, boosted by the modern obsession with celebrity, the brain that overthrew Newton provokes a frisson in those who have seen it. Until 1996, its guardian was one Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who removed it from Einstein\\'s body in 1955. In the 41 years Harvey had it, he religiously topped off the preservatives in the jars in which it bobbed, jars that sat on shelves in his basement or jostled in his car trunk as he moved about the country. (One such trek was the subject of Michael Paterniti\\'s irreverent Driving Mr. Albert [2000]). With a wider ambition than recounting one weird road trip, Abraham teases apart the strands of the whole bizarre, convoluted, ghoulish story of what happened to Einstein\\'s brain. She turns in a fine narrative replete with Harvey\\'s vague claims to the brain, his peregrinations, his parceling out of pieces of the brain to neuroscientists, and the results, such as they are, of their search for physiological evidence of Einstein\\'s genius. Abraham\\'s account covers all the angles--scientific, ethical, and humorous. Gilbert TaylorCopyright  American Library Association.

A performance artist and poet who has worked as a creative writing instructor, she discusses movingly how she overcame clinical depression in this candid memoir. Addressing the special circumstances of being both depressive and an African American woman, she notes, for example, that talking about one\\'s parents is frowned on in African as well as African American culture. Her parents divorced when she was growing up in Washington, D.C., and she carried around suppressed rage at the father who abandoned her and the mother whose lover she claims sexually abused her. After she fled to Los Angeles in 1991, her world fell apart when, as she tells it, her common-law husband threw her out along with their two-month-old daughter. With the help of therapists, Danquah ultimately confronted these traumas and the self-hatred induced partly by pervasive racism. Yet antidepressant drugs numbed her and drove her to alcohol. She kicked both habits and now overcomes the blues (the book\\'s title is from a Billie Holiday song) through music, meditation and vigilant monitoring to avoid self-destructive situations and moods.

While there is no shortage of books describing long struggles with depression, Danquah\\'is one of the first works to focus on the needs and experiences of black women suffering from clinical depression. As Danquah points out, black women suffer from the additional burden of being viewed in many quarters as tough, enduring figures, those who give solace but who rarely require it themselves.

From their lodges on the endless Montana plains, the members of the Lone Eaters band of the Pikuni (Blackfeet) Indians live in harmony with nature, hunting the \"blackhorns\" (buffalo), observing a complex system of political administration based on mutual respect and handing down legends that explain the natural world and govern daily conduct. The young protagonist is first called White Man\\'s Dog, but earns the respected name Fools Crow for meritorious conduct in battle. Through his eyes we watch the escalating tensions between the Pikunis and the white men (\"the Napikwans\"), who deliberately violate treaties and initiate hostilities with the hard-pressed red men. At the same time, the feared \"white scabs plague\" (smallpox) decimates the Lone Eaters communities, and they realize that their days are numbered. There is much to savor in this remarkable book: the ease with which Fools Crow and his brethren converse with animals and spirits, the importance of dreams in their daily lives, the customs and ceremonies that measure the natural seasons and a person\\'s lifespan. Without violating the patterns of Native American speech, Welsh writes in prose that surges and sings. This bittersweet story is an outstanding work.

As we follow White Man\\'s Dog (later renamed Fools Crow), we see how some of his people try to follow the Napikwan ways, others rebel against them, and many ignore them.

       " '0813531047': 'Since its invention, television has been one of the biggest influences on American culture. Through this medium, multiple visions and disparate voices have attempted to stake a place in viewer consumption. Yet even as this programming supposedly reflects characteristics of the general American populace, television-generated images are manipulated and contradictory, predicated by the various economic, political, and cultural forces placed upon it.  In Shaded Lives, Beretta Smith-Shomade sets out to dissect images of the African American woman in television from the 1980s. She calls their depiction \"binaristic,\" or split. African American women, although an essential part of television programming today, are still presented as distorted and deviant. By closely examining the television texts of African-American women in comedy, music video, television news and talk shows (Oprah Winfrey is highlighted), Smith-Shomade shows how these voices are represented, what forces may be at work in influencing these images, and what alternate ways of viewing might be available.  Smith-Shomade offers critical examples of where the sexist and racist legacy of this country collide with the cultural strength of Black women in visual and real-lived culture. As the nation\\'s climate of heightened racial divisiveness continues to relegate the representation of Black women to depravity and display, her study is not only useful, it is critical.\\tBeretta E.

       " '0440229758': 'There\\'s the Logo Tribe, who \"exhibit name brands wherever and whenever  possible,\" the Digerati Tribe, who \"worship bytes and silicon chips,\" and the  Busybody Tribe, whose \"batlike ears stretched high to gather up every vibration  and echo.\" These are only a few of the exotic groups Percy Montmount has  identified in his immense study of the human adolescent\\'s rituals, \"The Origin  of the Species Revisited.\" And what better person to record these behaviors than  one who is a member of no tribe? Ever since the death of his famous  anthropologist father three years ago, Percy has blocked his grief by becoming  an aloof observer of his classmates\\' odd rituals instead of an active player.  But lately, it\\'s gotten harder to classify his feelings as just biological  responses to outside stimuli. Stimuli like his attraction to Elissa, a sexy,  intelligent female biped, or his memories of Willard Stokes, the friend who  committed suicide after suffering from unrequited love for a member of the  Lipstick/Hairspray Tribe. And now that Graduation, that ultimate rite of  passage, is almost upon him, Percy may be forced by unknown factors outside his  tightly controlled environment to finally drop his field notebook and become  what he dreads most: an actual participant in his own life.  It is safe to say that there is no character quite like Percy in young adult  literature. His unique coping mechanism of classifying his peers into Darwinian  clusters is sheer brilliance on the part of author Arthur Slade, and makes for  an original and entertaining novel that will be enjoyed by teen, teacher, and  parent tribes alike. (Ages 12 and older) --Jennifer Hubert\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tSlade\\'s (Dust) dense novel inventively uses an anthropological lens to view high school life. Narrator 17-year-old Percy explains in a prologue that his anthropologist father died in the Congo three years earlier, after being bitten by a tsetse fly. The teen then reveals that on the night his father died, \"Dad materialized at my bedside, extended a ghost arm, and opened his fingers to reveal a pair of glowing spirit eyes... and inserted the magical orbs into my sockets.\" Percy thereafter refers to fellow humans as \"hominids\" and frequently relies on amusing anthropological jargon that occasionally grows grating. Yet the narrative effectively conveys why Percy is shunned by fellow students. His most astute observations come at the expense of his peers: \"Numerous tribes exist in friction at our school. The Logo Tribe exhibits name brands wherever and whenever possible.... The Lipstick/Hairspray Tribe performs elaborate appearance alterations to attract mates.\" He describes himself and his sole friend, Elissa as a \"cohesive group of two\" who are \"quasi-omniscient Observers.\" Other highlights include a mystical parallel with the Ndebele tribe, where his father was working at the time of Percy\\'s birth, and the tribe\\'s ritual marking a boy\\'s entry into manhood. Despite the hero\\'s awkward anthopologic-speak (\"No one ever knows what I\\'m talking about. What it means. No one!\"), readers who admire the fellow\\'s spirit may well enjoy this unusual treatise on high school culture; a concluding twist brings this tale down to earth. Ages 12-up.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tGrade 8 Up-Throughout high school, senior Percy Montmount has adopted a detached worldview, emulating his anthropologist father, who apparently died three years earlier. In the course of his days, he observes the school\\'s various cliques, or \"tribes,\" and then records what he sees in his voluminous notebooks. At the beginning of the novel, readers are privy to his often humorous views of his school and his mother, who is heavily into almost every New Age trend; later, the narration captures the distinctive and elaborate syntax of this brainy and somewhat weird kid. As the story progresses, however, the truth of Percy\\'s complex mental state is revealed-he is mourning the suicide of his best friend, he is confused by the mutual physical attraction between him and his friend Elissa, and he is angry with his dad. Finally, readers learn that his father is not dead, and that his parents are divorced. With graduation, everything comes to a head, and Percy begins to see that he has actually understood little of himself or others. The author has a good handle on his protagonist, and he explores the 17-year-old\\'s growth and self-realization with skill and subtlety. While some readers may be disturbed by the lack of details about Percy\\'s past, this is a good character study of an intelligent young man who is trying to grow up and gain an understanding of his world.Todd Morning, Schaumburg Township Public Library, ILCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tGr. 7-10. Percy Montmount likes to think of himself as an anthropologist--as was his father, who died after being bitten by a tsetse fly while he was working with the pygmies. But Percy\\'s area of examination is grade 12, where he observes the various \"tribes\"--like the jocks and the born-agains. The only other person in Percy\\'s particular tribe is Elissa; Will, their friend, killed himself. There are good things about this book. Percy has an original voice, and the surprise ending, in which readers learn that Percy\\'s father is only dead to his son (he left the family for another woman), packs some wallop. But this seems so unreal at times it goes beyond satire. The action takes place during the week or so before graduation, hardly enough time for Percy to suddenly be sent to the school psychologist and then be \"cured\" of his piercings and ravings by a visit from his father. And none of the kids talk about their plans after graduation. Maybe that happens in Saskatoon, where the book is set, but American teens will notice. For larger libraries that can afford to overlook the shortcomings and enjoy what is fresh. Ilene CooperCopyright  American Library Association.

When Larry admitted that he had written the songs, I asked him if he\\'d play others he wrote. He reluctantly agreed. Out came half a dozen amazing songs -- mostly funny ones. Since then, I have been a member in good standing of a small but utterly devoted Larry Gallagher fan club.  It will be clear when you listen to his music that Larry is a talented but troubled soul. His music is the struggle of a clever mind that can\\'t avoid examining the less flattering aspects of our thoughts. Almost every song is a meditation on some cruel paradox of consciousness: that we fail the people we love the most, that we do good things for selfish reasons, that we find peace only to lose it, that we take solace in other people\\'s imperfections...and on and on. When Larry turns on a bright light in the kitchen of his soul, all the roaches hold their ground. I don\\'t mean to make these songs sound self-important. Larry never takes these topics head-on but rather stalks them in smart and savvy ways. He is not offering a life philosophy with which to hum along. He knows better than you and I that our minds can\\'t defeat these dilemmas. But he shows that if you can turn them into song, you can momentarily cheat them of their power.\" Ethan Watters',\n",

Having crushed his enemies, consolidated his power base, and eliminated dissent at the end of Heroes of Might and Magic, Lord Ironfist settled down to rule the land of Enroth. After 25 years of peace, the land is again thrust into turmoil. Lord Ironfist is dead, and the ensuing battle for power between his sons, Archibald and Roland, has led to a state of war. Players must choose sides and summon their armies as they use all of their strategic wit and tactics in the battle for domination of the lands.\\tIn our March \\'97 issue (p79), we warned you against Heroes of Might and Magic, not because of the game, but because of the port quality. With the sequel, Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Prince of Loyalty, we can skip right to gameplay, because there\\'s nothing wrong with this version technically. The game mechanics haven\\'t changed much from the original: You still control castles and heroes, and your goal is to take over the other castles and defeat all other heroes on the gameboard. There are six different types of heroes and castles - barbarian, sorceress, wizard, warlock, necromancer, and knight - which control different species of fantastic creatures - goblins, druids, golems, rocs, mummies, and calvary, to name just a few. Castles provide troops and the funding needed to hire them. To improve both troops and income, a hero needs to claim control of a variety of building materials scattered throughout the countryside. Improving the fortifications requires wood and stone and leads to better defense, whereas mercury, gold, and sulfur allow you to upgrade the mage tower which gives a hero more spells to cast. Opposing heroes vie for control of these resources. The sequel adds more hero types (necromancer, wizard) and their associated monsters (vampires, halflings). There are more buildings on the playing field, and you can climb a tower to get a glimpse of the surrounding countryside, even of places you can\\'t physically reach yet. The castles have been upgraded, with more options: You can build a captain\\'s quarters, turrets and a moat for defense. If a hero isn\\'t in the castle when it\\'s attacked, the captain leads the defense. You can also upgrade the creature habitats: cavalry become champions, giants become titans, and liches become power liches. Battle mechanics are slightly different from the original. Your hero gets a number of spell points, and once he or she runs out, no more spells may be cast. There are also some new battle spells: the \"death ripple\" is amusing to watch as it ripples along the screen, wounding all living creatures in its path. The death ripple can be countered with a \"holy word\" spell, which clouds the video and wounds undead creatures, such as vampires and liches. If your hero runs out of points, you can take him or her to a castle to recharge (but not during battle). Completely new in the sequel are campaign intros which introduce the opposing forces. You can choose to play the good (outcast and honorable) or evil (in power but oppressive) side. We found the campaign scenarios difficult after the first few levels. If you get stuck, play a standard game, and work up to beating the expert levels at the highest difficulty rating, and then go back to the campaigns. The game is zippy on a standard Power Mac. However, if you\\'re running on a 68040, turn off ambient animations and computer opponent animation. Our only nit to pick with Heroes II is that we wish that ports would use the standard file dialog for saving and opening games, and that the light source for shadows was in the Mac-standard upper left corner. Still, if you\\'re a role-playing or strategy fan, you\\'ll have tons of fun with Heroes of Might and Magic II. - Kathy Tafel Good News: Completely upgraded. Runs well on \\'040s.

Emmy Everett, who has been living in Rhode Island and working at a tackle shop since leaving her fiance three years earlier, reluctantly returns to Scarsdale, New York, for the wedding of her older brother, Josh, to his longtime girlfriend, Meryl. Emmy is shocked when Josh tells her he\\'s been seeing another woman, Elizabeth, on the side. Elizabeth, a thirtysomething single mother with a teenage daughter, is nothing like the polished, sophisticated Meryl, but when Emmy meets her and her daughter, Grace, she realizes nothing is as clear-cut as it seems. Josh\\'s struggle over what he wants gives Emmy insight into her own inertia and her failed relationship with Matt, whom Emmy finds she is not quite over. So much happens in Dave\\'s wonderfully plotted first novel that it\\'s hard to believe the events all occur in the space of a few days.

       " '1861002785': \"Used for decades for enterprise distributed computing, SAP R/3 has a well-earned reputation for considerable power and difficulty. Recent new tools allow Visual Basic (VB) developers to work with SAP. Professional Visual Basic SAP R/3 Programming provides a useful glimpse into the world of SAP R/3, as well as some useful techniques for Windows programmers facing the world of SAP development for the first time. While SAP R/3 runs many of the world's largest businesses, most VB programmers have probably only heard of it. (There are many reasons for this, including the high cost of SAP software and the relative lack of information and training in comparison to Windows tools.) The first reason to read this book is to get a feel for what SAP R/3 is and how it works. To this end, this book is filled with screen shots featuring the latest SAP tools for the Windows platform (such as the SAP Assistant 3.0 and the new browser-based DCOM Component Connector.) SAP's new tools offer several VB (OCX) controls that allow VB programmers to call SAP functionality from within Windows.  The rule of thumb for the aspiring VB SAP programmer is that you must dig into the world of SAP business objects and APIs to make calls in VB. In several examples here, the author provides custom code that wraps the functionality of the SAP controls (for logging on, calling BAPIs, and loading table data, for instance) to make it a lot easier to work with SAP. This book is excellent at showing both realities of using SAP and some specific advice for approaching the world of legacy enterprise development.  There's little doubt that to benefit from most of this book, the reader will need some additional information about SAP R/3. Yet for the potential VB SAP R/3 programmer or manager facing integration with a legacy SAP system, this book certainly fills an important and useful role with plenty of information and a strategy for making this difficult leap. --Richard Dragan Topics covered: Introduction to SAP R/3, business objects and proxy components, BAPIs (parameters and help values), Remote Function Calls (RFCs), integrating SAP with Microsoft COM and Visual Basic, SAP Automation Toolkit, SAP Logon Control, SAP BAPI Control, SAP Table Factory Control, ADO, SAP Assistant 3.0 (Metadata Repository and Code Generator), SAP R/3 Business Object Repository Service, DCOM Component Connector (DCOM CC): basics, administrative, and builder functionality within VB.\\tA recent agreement between Microsoft and SAP makes Microsoft Visual Studio an acknowledged development environment for SAP R/3. SAP have recently developed, and made available as open download, a set of ActiveX controls designed to be used with Visual Basic to extend SAP R/3 and integrate it into existing Microsoft tools and applications.

All of us are different. Your idea of success may be different from mine. But there is one big factor which all of us must learn to deal with if we are to be successful and happy. The one common denominator to all success and happiness is other people. Various scientific studies have proven that if you learn how to deal with other people, you will have gone 85% of the way down the road to success in any business, occupation, or profession, and about 99% of the way to personal happiness. Merely getting along isn\\'t the answer. What counts is a way to deal with people that will bring us personal satisfaction and, at the same time, not trample on others\\' egos. Human relations is the science of dealing with people in such a way that our egos and their egos remain intact. And this is the only method of getting along with people that ever results in any real success or satisfaction.   The reason 90% of people fail in life is a failure to deal successfully with people. Look around you. Are the most successful people those with the most brains, the most skill? Are the people who are the happiest and get the most fun out of life so much smarter than the other people you know? If you will stop and think a moment, the chances are that you will say that the people you know who are the most successful, and enjoy life the most, are those who \"have a way\" with people. Your personality problems are your problems with other people. There are millions of people today who are self-conscious, shy, and ill-at-ease in social situations. They feel inferior and never realize that their real problem is a human relations problem. It never seems to get across to them that their failure as a personality is a failure in learning to deal successfully with people. There are almost as many who, at least on the surface, seem to be the very opposite of the shy, retiring type. They appear to be self-assured. They are \"bossy\" and dominate any social situation they are in, whether it is the home, the office, or the club.  Yet they, too, realize that something is missing. They wonder why their employees or their families do not appreciate them. They wonder why people do not cooperate more willingly; why it is necessary to continually force people into line. And, most of all, they realize in their more candid moments, that the people they are most anxious to impress never really give them the approval and acceptance they crave. They attempt to force cooperation, loyalty and friendship; to push people to produce for them. But, the one thing they cannot force is the thing they want the most: they cannot force people to like them. They never really get what they want because they have never mastered the art of dealing with people. Whether we like it or not, people are here to stay. In our modern world, we simply cannot achieve any success or happiness without taking other people into account. The doctor, the lawyer, the salesperson who enjoys the most success is not necessarily the one who is the most intelligent or the the most skillful in the mechanics of his or her job. The husband and wife who are the happiest are not the ones who are the most attractive. Look for a success in any endeavor and you will find someone who has mastered the knack of dealing with people a person who has a \"way\" with others. Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you\\'re doing it. As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task.  Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who \"has a way,\" but it doesn\\'t work for you. The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time. Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him. The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people. Read on and you will learn how.',\n",

The veterinary teaching hospital where I worked was across the bridge from my apartment. Although the drive to work was short and pretty, my job was anything but. Until an animal health technician position opened up, where I could use my newly acquired skills, I was stuck on kennel duty and I hated it.I quickly cleaned and fed the patients in the cat ward. Then I moved to the large dog runs. Hot water shot out of the hose, sending excrement and bits of food rolling down the trough to the drain at the end. Even with my nose clamped shut, I could taste the smell at the back of my throat and I knew it clung to my clothing when I went home.Finally I came to the smaller cages on the dog ward. It was quiet that day and I progressed quickly until I came to the last cage. Inside, to my astonishment, crouched a tiny kitten, thin and filthy, its eyes crusted and running. Too young to be away from its mother, but not old enough to be vaccinated, this kitten was in the no-man\\'s land of infectious disease. And he\\'d been abandoned.I cleaned him up as best I could, but he was just a baby and a messy one at that. His coat was stained and matted from one end to the other, and when I set down his dish of warm gruel I saw why.

I hoped he\\'d find a home but I knew his chances were slim. There was no way I could take him; my apartment was strictly No Pets.

There are many students of the language nowadays who have studied Japanese for several years at school, lived in Japan for a few years, or have Japanese-speaking family members, and are able to speak and communicate in Japanese. However, many students have major problems when it comes to reading Japanese.  The biggest stumbling block is the large number of kanji that have to be learned before one can read almost anything in Japanese. Kanji are visual images; they cannot be learned by ear, the way students pick up their speaking ability. At the same time, students with a limited knowledge of kanji will almost certainly have difficulty in understanding the news on TV or radio, because their Japanese vocabulary will be too limited. Due to the nature of the language, the breadth of one's vocabulary in Japanese depends in good measure upon the number of kanji one has acquired.  In order to start reading Japanese newspapers and magazines, students need a minimum reading knowledge of around eight hundred to a thousand commonly used kanji. The more kanji they can recognize, the better they will be positioned for reading; of course, they can always use a kanji dictionary for less frequently occurring kanji. Judging from our teaching experience, it is not easy for students to reach the stage where they can readily pick up and read Japanese newspapers or magazines. Those who happen to live in Japan have the advantage of being exposed to kanji every day, but it is still far from easy. For those who do not live in a kanji environment, that stage is even harder to achieve.  One of the things that make kanji study difficult is the lack of study and teaching materials in languages other than Japanese. Japanese kanji specialists are not oriented to teach non-Japanese students, nor are they versed in languages other than Japanese, or perhaps Chinese. Many books are published for Japanese children studying kanji but few students of Japanese as a second language are ten-year-olds with hours every day for years ahead to spend learning kanji, nor do they have the photographic memory that young children learning kanji seem to develop.  Decoding Kanji has been written to make this situation a little better, to make the study of kanji a little easier by giving structure to it. Our approach is to make students understand, as much as possible, (1) the relationship between each kanji form and its meaning, and (2) the relationship between a kanji form and its on (Sino-Japanese) reading. It is our hope and belief that this method will free students from the cumbersome task of rote memorization of kanji one by one.  The emphasis throughout the book is on the importance of learning kanji forms accurately. Learning the forms of kanji accurately from the very beginning is crucial for later success in mastering more and more kanji. We have seen many students start out with too vague a knowledge of kanji forms and have great difficulty later, as they encounter increasing numbers of similar-looking kanji. To avoid this, we use a contrasting approach right from the start.....  ... When students see these kanji explicitly contrasted, they become sharply aware of the differences between them, negating the impression that these kanji are vaguely similar, which they are liable to pick up when they learn them separately.  The discussion of kanji in Part 1 is crucial to understanding Part 2, and to successfully doing the exercises there. The exercises are arranged to make students understand the form-to-meaning relationship first, and then the form-to-on-reading relationship. Sections A and B contain simpler kanji, in less complex contexts, and are aimed at beginning to intermediate students. The last two sections, C and D, introduce more complex kanji, in more complicated contexts, for intermediate to advanced students.  In total some seven hundred kanji are treated in the text and exercises of this book, kanji that are commonly used in newspapers and magazines. Including the kanji in the appendixes, the number exceeds twelve hundred, more than adequate for reading newspapers and magazines with the occasional aid of a kanji dictionary. The terminology of specialized fields may use less common kanji; however, the emphasis of this book on the relation of kanji forms with their meanings and on-readings should provide a solid foundation for further study of less frequent kanji.  The etymological study of kanji is extremely complicated, because the history of kanji is so long. Thus, determining the structure of kanji is fraught with difficulty, and does not allow an easy shortcut for kanji study. Nevertheless, we hope that this book will be a stepping stone for further study of kanji itself, in addition to being a useful guide for the study of reading Japanese.\",\n",

       " 'B000C9RKFC': 'Embracing your sexual pleasure isnt easy if you dont know how to reach orgasmor if reaching orgasm is so time-consuming and complicated that you would rather watch television instead. Lets face it: Many women do not know how to self-stimulate, and even those that do are too embarrassed or nervous to try it, especially with their partner. However, if you dont know how to make yourself feel good, you are going to have a very hard time showing your partner how to make you feel good.  Sex toys can play a big role in helping women to get in touch with their sexual desires and release their inner vixen. However, many women still shy away from purchasing a sex toy, which is no surprise, considering how male-dominated the sex toy business is. Entering a sex toy store and purchasing a gigantic dildo, all while being leered at by the man behind the counter, doesnt exactly sound like most womens idea of fun.  Thankfully, women now have a niche in the sex toy field. You can now purchase a toy discreetly on the Internet, and in 3-5 business days, you will be the happiest woman on your block. More importantly, the toys themselves have changed. Forget the scary-looking implements with names like Big John. The Berman Center Intimate Accessories Line was created exclusively for the comfort and pleasure of women, which is why the toys are discreetly packaged, aesthetically pleasing, and quiet.   Aphrodite is one of the first toys we created, and it is geared specifically to helping women achieve sexual pleasure for the first time (or, for the first time in a loonng time). Anorgasmia (the medical term for people who experience regular difficulty reaching orgasm) occurs more often than you might think about 15 percent of women report difficulties with orgasm, and as many as 10 percent of women in the United States have never climaxed.  Enter Aphrodite! Named appropriately after the goddess of love and sexual pleasure, Aphrodite is a sure thing. Simple to use, Aphrodite is a foolproof way to help you enjoy orgasm, whether it is your first time or your millionth!  And, here is the good news: vibrators are for use among couples and single folks alike, and they are a safe, healthy, and normal way to experience sexual pleasure.    Allow me to banish some common vibrator myths (hopefully for good!):    A vibrator will numb me or harm my genitals  A vibrator will replace my partner  A vibrator will cause me to become \"addicted\" and unable to have an orgasm without it  The Berman Center led a nationwide study of sexual aids and devices in 2004. The results leave little question about the benefits of vibrators and refute just about every vibrator myth out there. My national study found that: -Women who used vibrators experienced better sexual function and a more satisfying sex life. Vibrators were linked to higher levels of arousal, increased libido and easier, more frequent orgasms. Not surprisingly, women with vibrator experience were more sexually satisfied than their non-using counterparts.  -Vibrators are not only for the singles! In fact, we found that while 30% reported using a vibrator, more than 60% of partnered women did. Vibrators have a place for couples and men are generally supportive if you include them in the fun.  -Women with vibrator experience resoundingly disagreed with statements like: \"My vibrator has replaced my partner\" and \"My vibrator use has negatively affected my sexual sensation.\"  These findings support the idea that vibrators bring only good things to your sex life. Vibrators enhance arousal with higher quality, longer-lasting foreplay and increase a womans chances of orgasm.\\tThe Dr. Laura Berman Intimate Basics Collection is designed by women, for women to give you and your partner exactly what you need; color, ergonomic designs, discreet packaging, superior quality, quiet and powerful devices.

Entrepreneurs must understand the problem, face the challenge, and possess the skills necessary to address the problem. Because their resources, time, and training are limited, entrepreneurs must understand the private placement, a unique process that demands a capitalization strategy.Most importantly, entrepreneurs must embrace the investor perspective. In this one-of-a-kind book, Angel Financing provides a strategy that works. Hundreds of people have used the principles detailed in this book to raise millions of dollars.The value of the angel investor, after all, can no longer be denied: Angel capital is the primary source of capital for early-stage deals. This fact alone accounts for the plethora of matching networks, seminars, and venture forums on the subject. Although the huge contribution of the angel capital market in creating jobs, expanding the tax base, and increasing our global competitiveness through technological innovation is well known, little is understood about the angel equity market and how deals really get done.Moreover, over the last ten years, the authors have built the largest angel database in North America and interviewed thousands of investors about the nature of the pre-IPO investment process. Through their proprietary research and their comprehensive development of a typology of investors, the reader will not only be better positioned to identify and qualify investors, but will also be better sensitized to prepare the documents and the sales strategy to close their deals.In Angel Financing, the angel investors tell their stories in their own words. The reader learns in depth about the forces that create this investment opportunity in high-risk investing. The reader journeys through the investors? hedging strategies, risk assessments, syndication orientation, financial return expectations, deal structuring preferences, monitoring investments, harvesting returns, and realistic exit strategies.What?s more, many investors themselves do not understand the valuation process involved in \"blue sky\" deals where there are no historical financials available. The valuation process is an art form in early-stage investing and for the first time it is candidly reviewed.Even more important is the due diligence process. Angel Financing answers the most basic questions that sometimes even investors are too embarrassed to ask. So for straight talk on how to make money in this market, get the insights of the successful investors who have made millions.In the United States, two million investors possess the discretionary net worth necessary to invest in pre-IPO private placements. Why is it that only 250,000 to 300,000 are active each year? The reason is that these investors?while interested?do not understand the process, do not understand how to find the deal, do not know how to determine which deal justifies their efforts, and do not know how to develop a hedging strategy.Whether you are a dreamer, dream maker, or providing services to either, Angel Financing is the ultimate practical reference guide to add to your professional business development library.GERALD A.

But how well do we really know him or his remarkable family, whose history often mirrors the history of America? Now, in the first full-scale biography of the Bushes, Peter and Rochelle Schweizer trace the extraordinary trajectory of their rise to power. Through a series of exclusive, surprisingly candid interviews with members of the family and close friends, the inner workings of this very private family are revealed: their marriages and friendships; the intense sibling rivalry between George W. and Jeb Bush; divisions between father and son over the Iraq war; even Jeb Bush\\'s plans to run for president in 2008. Never-before-seen private photos add even greater detail and depth to this fascinating family portrait. And above all, we see George W. Bush the way his family does, as an intensely driven person who has a much more complex relationship with his father than has often been portrayed in the media. Family members talk about how he deals with the stresses of the war on terrorism, why he sees it as a \"religious war,\" and how his personal faith influences what he says and does. The Schweizers also delve into the Bushes\\' sensitive and secret business dealings, including their long history of involvement in the oil business. Their shrewd alliances with other American dynasties, including the Kennedys, Rockefellers, and Tafts, have all helped to quietly consolidate their power within the Republican Party. Indeed, what makes the Bushes so successful is that they function less like the great political families before them and more like a high-tech startup: free-flowing, pragmatic, and opportunistic. It is this distinction that assures them an enduring presence on the nation\\'s political stage, making The Bushes essential reading for anyone who cares about America\\'s future.',\n",

What he\\'s keeping secret from his mother, however, is that, inspired by his attraction to a female friend, he\\'s becoming aware of his fundamental bisexuality. Solomon\\'s prose is stylish, sometimes beautiful, but it suffers from a vagueness that hovers about the relationships it describes (\"When something saddened me, she came and joined me in my pain,\" says Harry of his mother). The characters live in a world of upper-class homes and hotels in Paris, London and Manhattan, with weekends in country homes and maids and chauffeurs at their disposal, a backdrop of privilege that sometimes edges into preciousness (\"I associate my mother\\'s entire illness with cut flowers,\" Harry notes).

First-person narrator Harry is under 30, gay, and always striving for perfection in his music, his sexual partners, and his aesthetic rhetoric, with which he tries heroically (and sometimes pretentiously) to wring beauty from the ordinary while visiting stylish locations in London, Paris, and Manhattan. He observes the textures of flowers, different foods, the surfaces of bodies. Harry also picks a fight with his bland lover Bernard and has three intense affairs, one with a longtime female friend, to escape his depression over his mother\\'s terminal illness. Early in the novel, she blames her suffering on his homosexuality and tries to manipulate him into a more conventional life style: ``I know you think you\\'re being honest or true to yourself or something, but what you have with Bernard can\\'t be greater than that combination of love and children that you could have with Helen or someone.\\'\\' The mother, still in her 50s, does not want to die early, but she also doesn\\'t want her last days to be horrific. When chemotherapy does not appear to have halted the cancer, she plans her date with death as carefully as if it were a wedding, attending a party the week before in a grand show of matriarchal dignity as she climbs a staircase unassisted. ``One step at a time, regal as the Queen of Sheba, my mother climbed that staircase.

       " '0394578058': 'Fussell ( Food in Good Season ) documents the history of corn on many levels in this well-researched book. As food, fertility symbol, genetic marvel, and subject of ancient myths, corn is one of the oldest food staples and a truly American food source. And because the author covers so much material, it\\'s best to approach The Story of Corn bit by bit to avoid being overwhelmed. While it\\'s fun to read about the history of popcorn (popcorn poppers dating back to A.D. 100 have been found in Peru), it\\'s downright fascinating to read about what corn meant to native North and South Americans. Apparently corn was used in everything from funerals to birth rituals; corn images are embedded in the Hopi language. Fussell even tracked down a retired moonshiner to find out how corn was used to make corn whiskey and its more socially acceptable cousins, bourbon and Peruvian chicha . The author, descended from Nebraska farmers for whom corn was a mainstay, weaves her family\\'s history into the larger saga. And along the way, she unfortunately consorts with some rather highfalutinok language (\"The migration of my ancestors was across continents, up and away from the earth navel of fallen man. My own journey had been down . . . into the darkness of seeds and roots to find my dead mother and her mothers . . . in the womb not of Eden but of Mother Earth\"). But the volume is otherwise so absorbing and well written that she\\'s easily forgiven. Photos not seen by PW. Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tLike a modern variety of Zea mays , this book is a sophisticated hybrid, a skillful blend of history, science, art, and anthropology. Written in a lively and nontechnical style, with 150 photographs and 100 line drawings, it is an accessible, handsome volume. Fussell, food journalist, historian of foodways, and author of cookbooks, including the highly recommended Food in Good Season ( LJ 9/15/88), is known as a likeable and knowledgeable writer. These qualities are evident in this tour de force about corn, covering every aspect of this important commodity and offering an extensive bibliography. Anyone reading all or a substantial portion of this book will never pass a cornfield again in quite the same way. Recommended.- Richard Shotwell, Hancock Shaker Village, Pittsfield, Mass.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tFussell (Food in Good Season, 1988, etc.) has steeped herself in corn lore and emerged with this encyclopedic entry on that sustaining American grain in myth, ritual, history, science and technology, breeding and cultivation, industry, processing, and cookery (not recipes, just a survey)--with a chapter on corn whiskey thrown in and an interweaving of personal root-claiming by way of a Nebraska grandfather. Fussell has clearly done a good deal of research and a lot of traveling--peering over a precipice at Machu Picchu, descending into a restored ceremonial kiva of the Anasazi people in New Mexico, visiting the sole surviving corn palace from the Midwest boosters\\' glory days of a century ago--but her prose fails to vivify the scenes she\\'s visited, and, without any argument or added insights, her research reports have a secondhand, summarizing quality. Still, the labor and immersion are evident, and libraries should find uses for Fussell\\'s odd compilation.

Durable and easy to set up, this laser tool system provides precision results indoors and outdoors to help you get a variety of jobs done quickly and efficiently.  This laser line tool is compact, durable, and easy-to-operate for reliability on the job (view larger).  The PLS360 simplifies a wide range of layout and quality control tasks (view larger).              PLS360 360 Degree Laser Level ToolAt a Glance:  Fully self-leveling laser tool with one-button setup for indoor and outdoor applications For fast, simple layout of acoustical ceilings, HVAC, and cabinetry Operates on 3 D batteries for over 55 hours Includes hard carry case, wall bracket Final assembly and calibration in the USA Three-year limited warranty           This laser line tool measures 3 x 5 x 4-1/2 inches and weights just two pounds for portability around the job site. It includes a hard-shell carrying case to help protect it from the rough realities of construction work, and it\\'s also available in a system package that includes the SLD laser detector for expanded utility in exterior applications and a kit package that comes with both the SLD laser and a tripod. The PLS360 is powered by three standard \"D\" batteries (included), and it can run over 35 hours between battery changes. All PLS tools are designed and manufactured to meet strict quality control guidelines, and the PLS360 is backed by a three-year limited warranty. Simplify Layout Tasks and Increase Productivity There are lots of construction applications that demand 360-degree performance, including installation of cabinets, acoustic ceilings, foundations, and swimming pools, and the PLS360 delivers fast, error-free setup to help you accomplish whatever job is at hand with precision. With the PLS360, there\\'s none of the tricky knob adjustments or easy-to-damage moving parts that can make rotary laser setup a big time commitment. There\\'s simply a single-button that provides access to a visible indoor working range of 100 feet. This means you can project bright lines that are easy on the eyes across a full circle with a 200-foot diameter. The PLS360 is accurate within 1/8-inch over 100 feet. Packaged without a detector, this tool is best suited for interior work like installing small ceilings in hotels, school rooms, and office buildings where fast set up is required. For effective outdoor use, the PLS360 is also available as two packages that includes the SLD laser detector (not included in the tool package), which detector allows this tool to deliver reliable readings over extended distances--up to 250 feet--and in bright light conditions.    Includes hard carry case and wall bracket (view larger).  PLS Benchmark Dampening Ensures Consistent, Reliable Layout Results Like all PLS point-and-line laser alignment tools, the PLS360 is fully self-leveling, and it takes full advantage of the patented PLS pendulum design and magnetic dampening to deliver real, usable results. Dampening is the settling down effect on the laser beam, and thanks to this advanced technology, all PLS point and line lasers settle down instantly when moved to a new layout point. Additionally, this system compensates for job site vibrations caused by compressors, generators, and other heavy equipment, preventing the laser point from \"jumping\" around and ensuring that your laser delivers accurate, usable information. This helps your team get jobs done right the first time to save you time and money. Three-Year Limited Warranty PLS has upgraded its warranty from a single year to a three-year limited warranty. During this warranty period, your PLS product will be repaired or replaced (with the same or similar model at our option), without charge for either parts or labor, through PLS. If your laser tool ever does need to be serviced, PLS offers fast, 48-hour factory turnaround on repairs or replacements to help ensure that your PLS laser line tool continues to provide accurate performance and improved productivity for the full duration of your career. About Pacific Laser Systems Built by contractors for contractors, PLS tools were developed out of necessity by professional carpenters with over 50 years of experience in commercial and residential interior and exterior layout, and they\\'re recognized as some of the finest point-to-point and reference line layout tools in the world.

Historically, this position, which fell to one of the Tower guards, was to care for the ravens that live within the walls of the fortress as a token of luck to keep it from falling to its enemies. Forrest has grown up in the Tower and has his own pet raven, Tuck. He feels confined and sheltered from the outside world. Bullies make fun of him. When dangerous Scottish rebels are captured and imprisoned, he hopes to show his bravery. His responsibility, however, turns out to be to take food to the young daughter of one of the rebels. As he learns more about Maddy, he comes to admire and respect her, and realizes that if he does not help her escape, she will be executed. To do so, though, he will have to go against all he has been taught. The story has its share of suspense, excitement, and interesting characters. Set in 1735, it does not flinch from describing the brutality of the time, including public hangings, which Forrest\\'s mother loves to attend. While some of the plot elements may seem unrealistic and the ending too pat, the story is certainly satisfying.

Though often lonely, Forrest makes three friends: a raven, a young rat catcher, and, more dangerously, a Scottish girl imprisoned in the Bloody Tower.

       " 'B00002SFLK': 'Holy Civilization! Something history textbooks seldom capture because they must overcome the limitations of two dimensions, is the painstaking evolution of society. Not to mention how fragile it all is. This real-time strategic simulation of building settlements from ground up is a compelling lesson in just that. Players choose to rebuild the ancient societies of the Romans, the Egyptians or the Asians and work at developing a thriving economy and a powerful military in order to sustain and progress society. None of this is easy. Citizens have to be trained to build structures (110 different buildings), they must weapons, mine ore and grow food. Prosperity depends on wise choices of more than 30 different trades--including woodcutters, hunters, fishermen, farmers, brewers, stone masons, merchants, and priests. Military tactics to protect the settlement and develop trade routes requires legions of archers, swordsmen and spearman ready for battle. What is amazing about his game is that all of this comes to life on-screen, under your nose: The incredible graphics conceptually are like those of the popular \"Civilization II,\" but much more close-up and zoomed-in, so when hundreds of villagers are moving through daily life on your screen, you can see the individual animation of each one--more than 150 characters brought to vivid reality with over 50,000 phases of animation. And the sounds! Hear fish jumping in the stream, or pigs snorting, or laborers breaking boulders. Even birds chirp in this micro, complicated world that Sim City and battle-strategy freaks will find impressive and deliciously animated.

But this musical mix is used in an extremely unorthodox and unpredictable way -- they don\\'t play it safe by lumping all the similar styles together. For example, they\\'ll follow up a beautiful guitar interlude (the album\\'s opener, \"The Rose Garden of Mystery\") with a jarring surf rocker (\"Waves of Blood\"), which will then lead to a reverb-drenched freak-out (\"Broken Glass Hearse\"). But the real story on the sophomore effort by Secret Chiefs 3 is guitarist/leader Trey Spruance. In addition to guitar, he produced and engineered the album, filled in for missing bassist Trevor Dunn (still a member of the band), and wrote eight of the record\\'s ten tracks.

       " 'B00002SFLC': 'East Front 2 is a stand-alone game that combines all the scenarios, campaigns, units and nationalities found in East Front and Campaign, while adding the new gaming features and improvements of West Front. It is tactical combat on the Eastern Front at its most complete and very finest. Besides compiling the features of the previous games, East Front 2 also gives over 45 all-new scenarios, two new Dynamic Campaign Games, and two Linked Campaign Games, battles that can be found only in this release.\\tIgnore the fact that there\\'s a Roman numeral in the title. East Front II is not a sequel, but rather a \"gold\" edition. Basically it\\'s all the original East Front scenarios, the campaign disc, and 50 new scenarios upgraded with the advances found in West Front. Yes, that\\'s right, Talonsoft has gone the Sierra route and rereleased a game that originally suffered from severe bug infestation. Yet even Sierra would at least have included a rebate if you already owned the original game, something you won\\'t find in East Front II\\'s box. Instead, as a concession, you can order East Front II through Talonsoft at a discounted price, but tough luck if you\\'ve already picked it up at a retailer - you\\'re stuck with full price.   So what\\'s new in East Front II? Well, imagine all the improvements of West Front, applied to the original East Front. This means better graphics such as contoured terrain features and vehicle camouflage schemes, several optional rules such as armor facing, a linked campaign mode, and a thick manual. Of course, everything you didn\\'t like about West Front is still present, such as the annoying supply rules (supply in a game where most scenarios represent an hour of real time? Come on, at least make the rules optional!). And oh yes, don\\'t forget that 50 new scenarios have been added. While veterans of the original East Front might have to take a long hard look into their wallets, picking up East Front II is a no-brainer for green recruits.  If you\\'re a newcomer to the world of computer wargaming, but grew up on board games, East Front II plays a lot like Avalon Hill\\'s Panzer Blitz or GDW\\'s Blood and Thunder. Turns represent six minutes, with most scenarios lasting from one hour to two hours of simulated time. A single unit represents a platoon, with individual strength points equaling half an infantry squad, a full MG team, an artillery piece, or a tank. The game is played out on a hex grid (each hex is 250 meters) and conforms to the standard \"side A moves and fights, then side B does the same\" style of play. Victory levels are derived from the control of certain hexes and the destruction of enemy forces while preserving friendly forces.   Because East Front II is a computer game, technology eases some of the burdens found in board wargaming. For example, true fog of war is possible without any convoluted double-blind system. The pain of setting up hundreds of cardboard counters is eliminated, as is trying to recall dozens of arcane rules and tables. The game is very user friendly, with plenty of online help, but most importantly the control scheme is very intuitive. The basics can be mastered in a few minutes, and the manual (weighing in at a nice 239 pages, and it even includes an index) does a good job of laying out all the tables one could want.  The graphics are pleasing to the eye, with a choice of three 3D views and two 2D views. In the 3D view the maps are laid out in an oblique manner, with terrain resembling that found in a diorama and units looking like hand-painted die-cast miniatures. The only downside is the poor sense of scale; tanks are as big as buildings, and the soldiers are all descendants of Paul Bunyon. The 2D view portrays the more traditional view found in board games, looking directly down on the terrain with units represented by icons. Unlike The Operational Art of War, the 3D view is actually playable and doesn\\'t detract from the player\\'s battlefield awareness.   One of the most impressive features of East Front II is simply the sheer size of the game. There are 150 single scenarios, a random scenario generator, an editor for crafting your own scenarios, and several campaign games. The dynamic campaign mode of the original is still present, but a linked campaign mode has been added. In the linked mode, the scenarios follow a \"tree,\" with the number of scenarios you branch into depending entirely on how well you fare. If none of that is enough, there\\'s also the slew of multiplayer options to extend gameplay, including the ability of 16 players to play over the Internet in one scenario! Imagine trying to get that many gamers together around your kitchen table!  While there\\'s something to be said for gaming against organic intelligence, another advantage of computer wargaming is simply the ability to provide an opponent for you. Many wargames make up for the lack of a decent AI by creating scenarios that are actually puzzles. In these puzzle scenarios, good tactics are always overshadowed by trying to figure out the proper use of your units in the situation. East Front II\\'s artificial intelligence puts up a good fight, and because of that, the scenarios are winnable by good strategy, not following a walk-through guide.   The biggest problem comes from the aforementioned supply rules that are totally out of place in a tactical game. Considering the background most of the scenario designers have with board wargaming, it seems strange that they allowed the supply rules to remain in the game. Some other problems include the inability to cancel an artillery attack and the console style of saving in a campaign. You can only save after a campaign scenario and never during the scenario. The rationale is to prevent \"cheating\" by retrying a scenario until you get the best score. Not everyone who wants to save during a campaign scenario is interested in cheating though; sometimes we just don\\'t have enough time to sit down for an entire session.   East Front II is everything the original East Front should have been when it was released. It\\'s big, engrossing, enjoyable, and true to its board game roots. It\\'s just a shame that Talonsoft would make it appear like it was a true sequel, and not including a rebate is just as shameful. Still, East Front II is the best tactical level wargame to come out in a long time. If you have the original game and the expansion CD, you\\'ll have to decide if the new features are really worth the money (and also take two points off the value score). For the rest of the world, dress warmly and expect to spend quite some time in those harsh Russian winters.--Scott R. Krol --Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In the second, a visiting state official promises he can resurrect the dead, prompting the villagers to exhume four bodies with startling results.

It tests your vocabulary, your ability to understand the relationships between words, and your ability to read and comprehend. Basically, though, it\\'s just a glorified vocabulary test. If you read the following strategies for answering analogy, sentence completion, and critical reading questions and have fun with our vocabulary section, you\\'ll be able to bury the serpent and maybe someday be a star contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  Four Key Rules and a Tip  On every SAT there are 19 analogies, 19 sentence completions, and 40 critical reading questions, for a total of 78 questions. In this chapter we will go over each type of question individually in order to familiarize you with the different question types, and then we\\'ll show you some slick tricks. But first, here are some general rules for doing the verbal section.  Rule 1: Know Your Speed  You are given only 75 minutes for the three verbal sub-sections. So you figure, \"Great, I have a minute per question.\" Wrong. You have to subtract about 20 minutes for the amount of time you need to spend reading the reading passages. Then subtract another minute from the total test time for the time you spend watching the kid in front of you pick his nose and maybe another half second for the time you spend picking your own nose. Now you have only about 40 seconds per problem. That\\'s just about the amount of time most people need if they work efficiently. If you find yourself finishing 10 minutes early, then you\\'re probably working too fast and being careless, or you didn\\'t spend enough time picking your nose. If you aren\\'t finishing all the questions before the time runs out, you might have to be a little less careful (or skip the last reading passage of each section, as described in Strategy 5 of the reading passage section of this chapter, page 50). In any case, it\\'s essential that you have practiced enough to know exactly how fast you should be moving. Good control of your speed and timing must be second nature to you when you take the real test.  Rule 2: Do the Subsections in the Best Order  All questions are worth the same number of points. There- fore, you want to have done as many problems as possible before you run out of time. Sentence completions take the least amount of time, so do them first. Then do analogies. The critical reading passages take the longest; do them last. (This is usually the order of the subsections on the test.) The only exception to this rule would be if you consistently find that you score better on practice tests when you do things in a different order.  Rule 3: Realize That Questions Get Harder  The Serpent gets more and more cruel as each subsection (a set of 10 sentence completions, a set of 10 analogies, etc.) progresses, except in the questions following each critical reading passage. The first question in a subsection is usually easy. The last question in a subsection is usually hard. This is important to remember, because if you know that you\\'re going to have to skip some questions, you might as well skip the hard ones.  This is also important because it can be used to outsmart the Serpent. You can use this principle to find correct answers to questions that you otherwise wouldn\\'t be sure about. How? Since the first few questions in a subsection are always easy, the obvious or most tempting guess is probably correct. The middle questions in a subsection are a little harder; on these questions the obvious or most tempting guess is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. On the last few questions in a subsection, the obvious, most tempting guess is probably wrong. This is a crucial concept. As we will explain in more depth later, a question is put at the beginning of a subsection if, in the Serpent\\'s experience, most students get it right. It is put at the end if most students get it wrong. The trick is to learn to pick the answer that \"most students\" would pick on the questions at the beginning of the section and at the end of the section avoid the answer that \"most students\" would pick. What we have explained here is just the basics of how to apply this concept. In Chapter 4 we provide a more advanced explanation, with additional useful strategies and tricks.  Remember, the questions get harder within subsections, not from section to section. So if you\\'ve finished with the analogies and are moving on to sentence completion, you\\'ll be starting with relatively easy sentence completions.  If you want an in-depth explanation of this rule and its uses, read the 500-page book Cracking the SAT and PSAT by Adam Robinson and John Katzman. They call it the Joe Bloggs principle.  Rule 4: Know the Directions  The directions are the same every year. You should not waste any time reading them during the test. Memorize them from your copy of Taking the SAT, available from your high school guidance office.  Quick Tip: If you skip a question because you don\\'t know the answer, put a mark next to it. We suggest an X for the questions you don\\'t think you\\'ll be able to figure out and a ? for the ones you think you\\'d get with more time, if you have it later on.  Sentence completions  \\tDefinition:\\tFill in the blank.  \\tNumber:\\t19 questions.  \\tPriority:\\tDo them first.  \\tComment:\\tNot that bad once you get the hang of it.  For each sentence completion question, the ETS presents you with a nice, logical sentence. The trouble is that one or two words are missing from it. Your job is to pick the correct missing word(s) from among five choices. All of the possible answers make sense grammatically, but only one will make sense logically.  Some students consider sentence completions to be the hardest part of the verbal section because they test your sense of \"sentence logic\" in addition to testing your vocabulary. We think they are the easiest part because you have a context to help you figure out the answer. For example:  The man was smelly so I plugged my ________.  (A)\\tear  (B)\\ttoe  (C)\\teye  (D)\\tsocket  (E)\\tnose  Each of these choices is okay grammatically, but why would you plug your eye, toe, ear, or socket if the man was smelly? You would plug your nose. Usually, the SAT questions are more sophisticated, but the logic is the same.  If you approach them properly, the sentence completion questions can be extremely gratifying. When you choose the right words to go in the blanks, the sentence will have a certain flow, a sort of magical aura that will suffuse your body with a warm, orgasmic glow.  The Basic Pattern  You should follow a basic thought pattern whenever you attack a sentence completion question:  1.\\tRead the sentence first, skipping over the blanks, just to get a feel for how the sentence is set up.  2.\\tRead the sentence again, and this time when you get to the blanks, guess on your own what the missing words should be. You may not be able to come up with a specific word, but all you really need to determine is the answer\\'s generic category-whether the word is a \"negative\" or a \"positive\" one. In the blank write a \"+\" or \"-\" to remind yourself what type of word you\\'re looking for. When there are two blanks, you should at least decide whether the two missing words are antonyms or synonyms, \"good\" or \"bad.\"  3.\\tCompare your guesses with the answer choices provided and see if any of them fit your general idea of what the answer should be.  4.\\tPlug in the answer that looks best and see if it makes sense.  5.\\tIf it clearly makes sense, then go with it. Otherwise, try all the other choices and pick the one that works best. As you\\'re trying choices, cross out the ones that you\\'re sure don\\'t fit. Then, if you get stuck and decide to come back to the question, you won\\'t have to waste time reading all of the choices again.  After some practice, these rules should become second nature, so you won\\'t have to go through a three-minute process on each problem.  Excerpted from Up Your Score.

       " '0966808401': 'What on earth is the Y2K bug? Also known as the Millennium bug. And sometimes referred to as the Year 2000 bug? Dr. Jeffrey Shepard defines the problem in easy to understand terms (it\\'s a date-related problem affecting many computers) and provides practical tips for those who could, unknowingly, be at risk -- which, according to Shepard, is most of us. How serious is the problem? According to Shepard, \"the year-2000 problem is a pervasive one, and it is going to take more than a dousing of your favorite bug spray to eliminate the problems.\" \"The year-2000 problem is broad and encompasses many, if not most, areas of our lives because our society has become so computerized,\" Shepard writes. \"While most of us are not directly involved with large businesses and government agencies that rely on mainframes and PCs to monitor and regulate systems and databases, we are the ones who will be most impacted if year-2000 problems affecting those systems are not addressed.\" Shepard highlights the role interconnectedness plays in causing potential problems in many facets of everyday life, including healthcare, travel, telecommunications, government services, power and water availability, and food supplies. He recommends people educate themselves regarding the year-2000 problem and assess their potential risk as part of developing an overall plan for tackling Y2K. \"We all have different life circumstances and, consequently, different levels of exposure to the year-2000 problem. There is no such thing as a single solution or strategy for everyone or every family,\" he writes. A psychologist who specializes in the treatment of stress-related disorders, Shepard promotes the making of informed decisions and offers guidelines in approaching the myriad potential problems that the year-2000 problem is presenting. \"To deal with the fear and worry that some of these questions and answers might create, it is important to have a plan or strategy for protecting yourself and those you care about.\" The book contains a Foreword by Marci Shimoff, co-author of Chicken Soup for the Woman\\'s Soul and Chicken Soup for the Mother^\\'s Soul, in which she states, \"Dr. Shepard explains the problems and risks involved with the year-2000 problem in a straightforward and candid way. More importantly, he provides specific tips that enable each of us to handle our own unique situation. . . .\" This well-researched and documented book is divided into two parts. Part 1 scopes potential risks and presents practical guidelines for coping with those risks. Part 2 provides hypothetical situations illustrating how typical individuals or families might plan for Y2K: a couple nearing retirement, a small business owner, a young professional couple with two children, and a single, working parent who is also attending college.\\tDr. Jeffery Shepard is a psychologist who specializes in the treatment of stress-related disorders. He became interested in the year-2000 problem when he realized the potential risk the date-related computer problem could create for his own private practice -- problems that would compound quickly because of the interconnectedness in the healthcare system, creating a domino effect. This interest led to further research on government agencies and private industry. He wrote the book, You and the Year 2000, A Practical Guide for Things that Matter, out of a growing concern for the potential impact of the problem on an unsuspecting general populace -- and the potential for increased anxiety and stress. Dr. Shepard received his Ph.D. in psychology at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. After receiving his Ph.D., he moved to the Seattle area where he practiced for five years. His professional affiliations have included the American Psychological Association, the Washington State Psychological Association, and the Biofeedback Society of Washington. Dr. Shepard also consults with companies on topics such as communications and leadership. He currently resides in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California.\\tExcerpt from Chapter 1 The Last Word -- You and the Year 2000 The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide in helping individuals --like you and me --protect  themselves from the problems that will occur if the millions of computer systems in government  and business don\\'t meet the immovable deadline of January 1, 2000. The potential impact is too  serious to not have a working knowledge of the problem and possible solutions -- and a  comprehension of your own level of risk. The fact that the year-2000 problem is causing a lot of people to work hard to reduce its  impact is not in question. The success they will have and the long-term consequences of these  problems is the subject of hot debate. In large part, it will be up to you to decide whether or not  you think the problem will be long lasting or of short duration. It is also important to keep in mind that the degree of risk associated within any particular  area is likely to change over time -- the year-2000 problem is a moving target. For example, if  banks and credit card companies successfully fix their computer systems, then perhaps you or  members of your family won\\'t need to carry cash to pay for that New Year\\'s Eve night on the  town.  But remember, the year-2000 problem is one of interconnectedness. Because one agency  may be year-2000 compliant does not mean it won\\'t have problems, especially if it works with an  agency that did not get its problems fixed. The year-2000 problem is significant for a potential  domino effect, and you will want to keep this in mind in considering your own year-2000  preparations.  Lastly, beware of individuals who try to scare you about issues related to the year 2000. Yes,  these issues can be alarming. But this doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t rational actions and preparations  that can be made. It is very easy to fall into the trap of making decisions based on fear and  worry. As a psychologist, I have found that many of the decisions that people later regret are the  ones stemming from being anxious, angry, or hurt. This book will give you the information to  make informed, sensible decisions about the year-2000 issues affecting you and your family. We can\\'t change the past and make the year-2000 problem go away by wishing, whining, or  complaining. What is important are the choices we make from this point forward. The decisions  and actions we take are what will determine the difference between being caught unaware and  being prepared. So, let\\'s begin! Let\\'s take charge of our future and prepare for what could be a  glorious new millennium!  Timely Tips -- Guidelines for the Millennium -- Region of the country and local conditions may be important factors to consider for yourself  and your family. -- Seasonal factors can be important. Remember, the brunt of year-2000 problems are likely to  occur in January, a cold winter month for most of us. -- Age is an important consideration in making year-2000 related decisions. Older people and  children are probably at higher risk because they are often more dependent on outside  services. -- Health is a significant factor. In making plans, consider your personal health and/or the  health of those important to you. -- Stay informed. Remember that the year-2000 problem is a moving target. Problems that exist  today may be repaired. New areas of difficulty may be revealed, however. It is important to  have current information as the countdown to the millennium proceeds.  -- Think in terms of interrelationships and the domino effect, (e.g. the big picture), not solely in  terms of isolated impacts. That is, if there is a year-2000 related power outage, what does  this mean? Obviously, it means you need to find a way to keep warm, but it also means that  you might have trouble finding fuel for the generator you bought because the gasoline pumps  are electric and, therefore, won\\'t pump fuel. How big an impact do you prepare for? This is the most subjective question that you need to  answer for yourself. Whether you prepare for a minimal, several-day problem, or month-long,  year-long or longer-term problem is up to you and depends on the impact you think year-2000  related computer problems are going to create. This will be determined, in large part, by your  comfort level with risk. The more risk averse you are, the safer you will want to be and the more  you will want to prepare.',\n",

What makes Secret Chiefs 3 different from Mr. Bungle is that there is no lead vocalist present (Spruance and Dunn sing on a few of the tracks), and the trio somehow manages to concoct even more mysterious and demented compositions than Bungle. There is also a more prominent Middle Eastern flavor to the music, which Mr. Bungle has only lightly touched upon in the past. What the two groups have in common are abrupt, unbearable noise bursts, tape sound effects, and plenty of inside jokes. Just about every type of music rears its ugly head at some point on First Grand Constitution and Bylaws, and the band has pulled off the damn near impossible by condensing almost all of these musical forms into one single track, \"Resurrection Day Soundtrack.\" Other highlights include the Devo-like closer \"White As They Come,\" the foreign marching sounds of both \"Assassin\\'s Blade\" and \"Zulkifar,\" and the classic 1960s sound of \"Inn of Three Doors.\" Music for those weary of the mainstream.

The addition of harper Derek Bell, who appears here as a guest artist but later joined the band as a full-time member, fulfilled Paddy Moloney\\'s original notion of what the Chieftains should sound like. Bell\\'s harp moved the band away from folk to an almost classical sound on occasion, but it also linked them to an instrumental tradition that stretched back more than a thousand years. The Chieftains still play the dance tunes with verve, but on tracks such as \"Morgan Magan,\" \"Carrickfergus,\" which the band later recorded with Van Morrison on Irish Heartbeat, and \"The Tip of the Whistle,\" the band finds a more lyrical mode than on their previous recordings. This 1973 recording also introduced the band to the movie world when filmmaker Stanley Kubrick became entranced by the haunting air \"Mna Na Heireann\" and used it on the soundtrack for Barry Lyndon.

       " 'B00009NRVZ': 'With a piano style somewhere between Chopin and George Winston, David Nevue brings melody and heart back to instrumental music. Perhaps Heartsong Review said it best when they described his music as \"hauntingly romantic.\" David\\'s music introduces us to a wilderness of musical ideas which the listener becomes anxious to explore.  Interestingly enough, if you ask David about his musical background he might surprise you. He comes not from a background of polished piano music, but grew up a typical 1980\\'s teenager strongly under the influences of such progressive rock artists as Rush, Pink Floyd, and Kansas. David pursued rock music as a career throughout his college years, playing keyboards for a number of garage bands.  It wasn\\'t until David\\'s college roommate introduced him to the piano music of George Winston that he began to consider a career as a pianist. \"Prior to hearing George Winston, my idea of \\'solo piano\\' went no further than classical music, a form a music I\\'ve never felt much connection with. Winston\\'s impressionistic style was at that time unlike any music I had ever heard. My roommate played Winston\\'s music all the time, and it just sort of seeped in. As a result, I found myself playing around with a few melodies at the piano and I just never stopped.\"  In 1992 David released his first album, \\'The Tower.\\' \"At the time I recorded The Tower I was listening to a lot of the band Renaissance. I was really going for that very poetic, artsy, dramatic piano sound.\" David promoted \\'The Tower\\' via mail order and at performances. Building on the support of his small but growing fan base, David put the profits from \\'The Tower\\' back into his music. His efforts eventually resulted his next project, \\'While the Trees Sleep\\' released in 1995. Since that time, Nevue has released several more CDs, including \\'The Last Waking Moment,\\' \\'The Vigil\\', \\'Postcards from Germany\\' and a \\'best of\\' collection called \\'Whisperings.\\'  Today, David markets his music almost exclusively via the Internet. He is the author of the book \\'How to Promote Your Music Successfully on the Internet,\\' and founder of the Music Biz Academy, an online resource for independent musicians selling music on the web.\\tThe Last Waking Moment is a thematic work based on a lucid dream David\\'s wife experienced several years ago. The dream, an intense vision of a face to face meeting with Christ, had a profound effect on his wife Julie as well as David himself. The music on The Last Waking Moment follows the dream journey though the \"Shadowlands\" to \"The Gathering Fields\".',\n",

No matter how you spell itjob, career, callingit still has curse written all over it. Maybe thats just the way its supposed to be. After all, it was the original curse word, as Adam first lived out the consequences of his cursed life by working the land for food. To this day, work ranks among the leading obstacles in many peoples lives.It seems the dreams of most working people revolve around arriving at a place where theyll no longer have to go to work. Thats not to say we dont enjoy some of the challenges along the way. But if you could dig beneath the surface, the primary objective of most peoples career is to eliminate the need for it.The primary objective of most peoples careeris to eliminate the need for it.Advertisers play to this sentiment, tantalizing their target audiences with depictions of financial freedom and absolute autonomy. Statewide lotteries are funded, one dollar at a time, by the pipe dreams of would-be early retirees. While money is the number one obsession in our culture, the ultimate end of wealth is emancipation from the workplace.It is common sentiment that work is something to be avoided.Work is universally portrayed as something that gets in the way of all the other things wed rather be doing. Work calls the shots. Its the factory whistle that awakens us each day from the dream of a life of leisure. Work drags us from our homes and subjects us to traffic jams and the shark-infested waters of competition. Work drops us back home in a heap at the end of the day, or at the end of a long business trip. Work tells us where we can live, what we should wear, when we can go on vacation, and how much we can spend in between. Wherever our hearts turn in life, work is there dictating the pace and saying yes or no to our heartfelt passions and desires.We Are What We Do?As young children, we are encouraged to dream of what we want to be when we grow up. Our educational system is oriented around shaping us into one of the molds that will define us as bachelors in business administration, economics, English, science, or education. Eventually, we refine our identity to the point that we fit nicely into one of the categories that can be found in the yellow pages, or a title on the organizational chart of the company where we work. And after all is settled, one of the first questions people ask when they meet us is, What do you do?In our culture, we are defined by what we do. And everything else revolves around it. Wherever the career opportunities take us is where we raise our families, attend our churches, and join the neighborhood pool. What we do precedes who we are.Theres just one problem. We dont want anything to tell us what to do. We love autonomy. So, in allegiance to our human nature, we make it our goal to cheat the system. We work for rapid promotions, we invest for early retirement, and we play the lottery to increase our chances of getting our freedom as soon as we canwinning back control of our lives while we are still young enough to enjoy it.As the headline for a retirement fund ad put it, Life is two periods of play separated by forty years of work.So work is a curse to be endured. At least, thats how the average person views work.But What About Christians?Surely, we Christians hold a more enlightened view of work. We have beheld the truth that work was ordained by God even before Adam and Eve invented apple pie. We know that God Himself worked and called it good. We embrace the ideal of working heartily, as to the Lord (Colossians 3:23, NKJV). We read the Bible and learn that God uses work to mold our character and meet our needs. We understand that work will be one of our joyous assignments in Heaven, not just the lot of those condemned to the other place.We have learned that work is not really a bad thing in Gods eyes.And yet, when it comes to being a Christian at work, many believers dont feel that way at all. We understand that work is not quite the curse we once thought it was. But in our quest to be a beacon of light to a lost world, we often see work as something that gets in the way. We long to live out our faith Monday through Saturday, but we have to go to work instead. We dream of how effective we could be for the Lordif it werent for this lousy job.We long to live out our faith Monday through Saturday, but we have to go to work instead.Somehow, we develop an either/or mentality: I can either be in the secular work world or I can be in ministry, but not in both. We have bifurcated work into these two distinct realms rather than seeing the both/and possibility. What if we could be in the marketplace and be in ministry at the same time? Suppose we saw our workplace as our church and our jobs as our ministry. Suppose we went after our workplace ministry with the same fervor and passion as a twenty-six-year-old youth pastor just out of seminary.The idea of being in ministry at work was something I had shied away from. I had been a pretty good church member, but work was a whole different ball game. Let me tell you my story, and youll see why ministry was pretty far from my thinking in my early career.I was a rising star at ATT. At age thirty, I was promoted to division level, one of the youngest ever. At thirty-three, I was to be nominated for the companys Sloan Fellowship Program, a key prerequisite for moving up the corporate ladder. But on the heels of a transfer from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Atlanta, I experienced a major disruption. What had been a smooth career path suddenly became rocky. At the same time, my marriage was in trouble, the consequence of eleven years of putting my career above everything else. Realizing that I couldnt hold my life together by myself any longer, I turned to God for help. On a starry night I will never forget, I walked out in the backyard and told God I was finally His. I gave it all up to Him. Its You and me, Lord, I said. I am going public with my faith. Im going to stand for something. Whatever happens, happens!I was changed forever that night. God gave me a new heart and a new attitude based on a deep gratitude for His forgiveness and His acceptance. I knew that I was loved for the first time in my life. I was ready to live for Him 24-7, but from that point forward, it got even harder to live a dual life.Away from the office, I devoured Christian books and Bible teaching to feed my spiritual growth. At work, however, I struggled to live out my faith in a world that seemed completely disconnected from the God I was getting to know. I dont mean I was struggling with sin and backsliding. For once, that wasnt the problem. Its just that I lived in a spiritual place that had meaning and purpose, yet I worked in an earthly place that now seemed antiquated and irrelevant. I wanted to move on to my new life, butthis old environmentworkkept getting in the way.As much as I tried, I couldnt seem to reconcile those two worlds. Attempts to tell my story and share my faith at work were awkward. And my efforts to operate by biblical principles seemed hypocritical in light of the old reputation that still followed me around. I wanted people to see a reflection of God in me, but I was convinced all they could see was the same old me on a new religious kick. I felt shackled to my past.I was so grateful for Gods forgiveness, I could hardly contain myself. He had started to restore my marriage; I was in love with my wife and kids in a way that I hadnt known before. And I was in love with God. I needed to do something bold. I kept dreaming of how effectively I could serve Him, if I could just get away from my job.Inevitably, I concluded that I should leave the old world and relocate permanently to a different one. After all, the disciples left their nets to follow Jesus.So I left the world of ATT behind and started a consulting business where I could live out my new life-purpose statement: to glorify God by teaching biblical principles to sales and marketing executives.At last I was free to be the new me without the constant reminders of what I once was. I could freely talk about my faith without apprehension that I might look like a hypocrite on religious dope. I was free to play on my Christian playground without fear of interruption.At least, thats how I saw it.But as I look back on that experience, Ive come to realize I may have walked out on an incredible opportunity. What better place to fulfill my new life-purpose statement than as Division Manager of Sales at ATT Information Systems? We had thousands of employees, hundreds of officesthere was unlimited potential. The more I understand about how God uses Christians in the marketplace, the more I realize that I had beensitting on a spiritual gold mine back at ATT. I just didnt recognize it.I had been sitting on a spiritual gold mine back at ATT.I just didnt recognize it.Two Lives Become OneOver the past two decades, Ive had successes both in business and in helping business people come to faith. Ironically, it took only one year for God to use the consulting business I started to lead me right back to a leadership role in the marketplacethe world of profit and loss, hiring and firing, performance reviews and sales incentives.

       " 'B00002SFLF': 'It took a couple of months, but the Dreamcast finally has a wrestling game. But before you run out and buy a copy of WWF Attitude, there\\'s really some things you must know about it. This game was produced on a very tight deadline. You see, Acclaim will lose its license to produce and sell WWF games on November 15. That means the company had to pump out this Dreamcast version as quickly as possible, because once 11/15 hits, no more copies can be manufactured. So the Dreamcast version is, essentially, a cleaned-up clone of the PlayStation version. The improvements are mostly limited to graphics (better textures) and sound (higher fidelity). Therefore, if you already own one of the other two versions of Attitude, and you are relatively happy with the version you have, you can pretty much sit this one out. The roster in WWF Attitude was reasonably current when the game was originally released on the PlayStation and the N64 back in August. Now, the lack of superstars like the Big Show, Chris Jericho, and the Dudley Boys really make the game feel much more dated. However, one plus is that D-Generation X has gotten back together recently, so at least that aspect of the game is correct. The game is reasonably good for a wrestling game, which is to say it has just about as many weird, quirky collision problems and \"which guy am I facing\" issues as the next game. The game shies away from much of the rampant button-mashing, which plagues other wrestling games, in favor of a more fighting-game-like approach. This means you\\'ll be doing a lot of \"left, right, down, button\" type of moves instead of just grappling, hitting a button and a direction, and watching the fireworks. Momentum also comes into play here, which makes it easier to pull off larger, grapple-based moves on your opponents if you soften him up with a few punches and kicks first. The game also has a few reversals here and there, so it\\'s important to vary your method of attack, especially against experienced players. There are also a whole lot of modes in the game, most of which are slight variations on the same type of match. You can throw down in standard versus matches, two-on-one fights, three-on-one matches, tornado bouts, and tag-team contests, among others. There are also modes based on some of the WWF\\'s more famous Pay-Per-View matches, like the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series. The Rumble pits you against 29 other wrestlers in an over-the-top-rope brawl. In the real thing, a new wrestler hits the ring one at a time, after a set interval, though here the number of simultaneous wrestlers never gets higher than four. There\\'s a slight pause while a new wrestler enters the ring, but it\\'s nothing too serious. Add to that various match conditions, like hard-core matches or first blood, and you have enough options to keep you creating your own pay-per-views for months. Graphically, WWF Attitude is a mixed bag. On one hand, it looks much better than the N64 and PlayStation versions of the game. It sports much better textures (though many of the wrestler faces still look pretty bad), a cleaner-looking crowd, and cooler effects. But on the other hand, as a Dreamcast game, it easily could have been better. The wrestler models are still on the blocky side, and the animation looks pretty choppy. The sound has been greatly improved from a fidelity standpoint, but the commentary still manages to sound a little choppy from time to time. Also, the commentary is a little too generic, staying away from calling out specific moves and only occasionally calling the wrestlers by name. With a few more months, this game could have probably turned out a lot better. But since the game is the very definition of the word \"rushed,\" it\\'s merely a rehash of the older versions of the game. If you didn\\'t buy the PlayStation or N64 version of Attitude in hopes that the DC version would beat them, then you\\'re getting a bittersweet victory. Yes, this is the best version of WWF Attitude, but no, it doesn\\'t live up to the potential of the license or the hardware, and it\\'s really a shame that Acclaim has to end its longtime relationship with the WWF on such a sour note.

       " '0691090084': 'Few have studied the issue of charter schools for as long or as closely as Chester E. Finn Jr., Bruno V. Manno, and Gregg Vanourek. The product of several years of analysis and detailed case studies, Charter Schools in Action is a comprehensive look at the various laws, policies, and personalities that make up this fledgling reform effort. Parents, teachers, policymakers, and especially potential charter school owners will find the information invaluable. In fact, Finn, Manno--both former U.S. secretaries of education--and Vanourek have so thoroughly documented their research that the book threatens at times to bury the reader beneath a mass of facts, figures, and graphs. Still, this is no dry tome. Interviews with superintendents and school owners are combined with detailed features of schools, students, and parents, many of which paint a rosy portrait of the program. There is no mistaking the enthusiasm and passion these men share for charter schools--they contend that they are one of the last hopes for renewing public education, and they want them to succeed. They do their best to dispel negative notions of the program, such as the complaint that they tend to underserve disabled children and that they rob funds from traditional public schools. And when they do point out problems, they also offer prescriptions for healthy change, arguing, for example, for better accountability and a built-in system of checks and balances. Charter Schools in Action is simply a must for anyone who seeks a solid understanding of the subject. --Jodi Mailander Farrell\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tFinn and his coauthors have held education policy positions during Republican administrations and at think tanks of a conservative stripe, so it\\'s no surprise they see enormous potential in charter schools. Still, even readers leery of this high-visibility educational reform movement can learn much from their study, which blends theory, analysis, polling, case studies, and assessment. Defining \"charter schools\" as \"independent public schools of choice, freed from rules but accountable for results,\" they distinguish these schools from the true privatization that vouchers represent. The authors describe specific schools, examine charter schools\\' achievements, and consider \"the accountability puzzle.\" They identify and respond to 10 major criticisms before addressing the political context in which charter schools develop and the results these schools are producing--in and out of the classroom and within their sponsoring systems. The authors believe charter schools can, with proper monitoring and support, overcome urban school systems\\' tendency toward bureaucracy and command-and-control regulation. In place of rigid controls, the authors would let the market (and transparency) rule.

       " 'B000NA6CQI': 'Dave Davis April 28, 2006 In the harsh realm of Los Angeles, a beleaguered young Latino messenger  grits his teeth and bears a constant stream of racist insults from just  about everyone he encounters, whether it\\'s nicknames like \"Taco\", \"Sancho\"  or \"Pepe\", or simply a greeting of \"Do you speak English?\" His bosses are a  trio of powerful Hollywood agents, the kind of Buddy Ackerman-esque  dickheads who feel that since they endured years of abusive behavior on  their way up, all underlings should similarly suffer. As part of his slow journey to becoming an agent, the messenger delivers  important \"packages\" for the agents - narcotics for pampered celebrity  talent who can\\'t find their motivation without a hit. The agents are  looking to be players in drug trafficking as well as showbiz, but when they  realize the messenger alone may not be sufficient for their quantities,  they convince him to involve his blind best friend Chris (against his  girlfriend\\'s wishes). Needless to say, things do not turn out well. \"In the Dark\" was certainly a pleasant surprise - the comedy is never  excessively quirky, the dialogue and crime aspect don\\'t come across in that  ubiquitous self-conscious post-Tarantino manner, and it makes a social  statement without being cloying or didactic. The solid cast (there are only  a half-dozen major characters) deliver very natural performances without  feeling \"written\", particularly our protagonist.  And the movie looks far  better than a little no-budget digital film has any right to, thanks to  first-time feature director Letia Miller\\'s confident eye and guidance of a  clever and unpredictable story. -- CHUD.comJeffrey Wells, June 3, 2006 A young, very determined Hispanic man (Brian Luna) wants to get out the  mail room at a major Beverly Hills talent agency, and so he delivers drugs  for and constantly sucks up to a small group of slithery agents, hoping for  favors. Of course, they respond with racial epithets and dismissive  attitudes. (They\\'re agents, right?) But Luna and his sightless pal (Matt  Clouston) are up to more than just brown-nosing. Letia Miller\\'s underplayed drama is, of course, a critique of the  reptilian mores that are said to be commonplace in the film industry, but  the saddest and most penetrating thing about \"In the Dark\" is Luna\\'s  willingness -- eagerness -- to humiliate himself with his agency superiors.  You want to grab him by the crew neck of his T-shirt and say, \"Stop it  dude!\"...but then, in the final act, you realize what\\'s really up. Are  agency people and their clients really as foul as Miller portrays them?  I\\'ve heard plenty of agency stories, but they tend to be funny rather than  repellent. Nonetheless, \"Dark\" deserves respect for sticking to its thematic guns,  and especially for its performances and its dramatic tempo, particularly  the back-and-forth in a scene between Luna and an African-American agent  (Lionel Carson) that renders an uncommonly frank admission of how the  agency pecking-order system works. -- Hollywood-elsewhere.comSome Light Moments In In The Dark, Louis B. Parks April 28, 2006   \"In the Dark\" is an appropriate title because it has several meanings in  this modest, sneaky little film. But the less said about that the better.  At first we think we\\'re getting social commentary with wry humor. Somewhere  along the way Dark turns into an offbeat buddy comedy and caper film. Paco is a star-struck Los Angeles messenger of Hispanic heritage in his  late 20s. He delivers for three Hollywood agents who treat him like an  illegal immigrant and an easy target for lame racist humor. When the agents  see that his Anglo buddy Chris is blind, they switch to sight jokes. The agents, scum in fancy suits, use Paco to make illegal deliveries  such as cocaine to their clients, figuring if he gets caught, so what? Paco  looks the other way in the hope of getting into their \"junior agent\"  program. When the agents start branching out into bigger drug deals, they  get Paco to recruit Chris, because no one would suspect a blind man. Kate,  Chris\\' girlfriend, gets wind of what\\'s up. She throws a fit, but Chris and  Paco decide to go through with one last big run. The description sounds darker than it is. The tone is amusing, much of  the dialogue is funny, and the climax is satisfying. Director Letia Miller,  who plays Kate, uses her limited budget wisely to flesh out the clever  script by Matthew Clouston, who plays Chris. All the acting is good, with  Brian Luna especially effective. -- The Houston Chronicle\\tA young Latino man (Brian Luna) working as a messenger for Hollywood\\'s power brokers gets fed up with the condescending, racially charged nicknames he\\'s constantly being given by his employers.

Phosphagen may also have a cell volumizing effects on muscle tissue which further stimulates an anabolic environment for muscle growth.

By enhancing cell volume and glycogen replenishment creatine may speed recovery from intense bouts of workouts.

As with his other novels, You Can't Go Home Again is an extremely personal work, but in the character of George Webber, a writer, Wolfe sees and captures America and the world in an dramatic time in history. The time is the period just before the great stock market crash and it stretches through the Depression and into Germany during the rise of Nazis. And the writer of course is Wolfe, who takes us on a ride through America never seen before--one with sharp insight and breathtaking flair.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tNovel by Thomas Wolfe, published posthumously in 1940 after heavy editing by Edward Aswell. This novel, like Wolfe's other works, is largely autobiographical, reflecting details of his life in the 1930s.  As the sequel to The Web and the Rock (1939), You Can't Go Home Again continues the story of George Webber, a thoughtful author in search of meaning in his personal life and in American society. Leaving New York City, he is dismayed at the social decay he finds on his travels to England, Germany, and his small hometown in the Carolinas. Nonetheless, he is optimistic about the future of the United States.  -- The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tThomas Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, among the Blue Ridge Mountains in Asheville, North Carolina, a childhood which he immortalized through the creation of Eugene Gant, the hero of Look Homeward, Angel (1929). Wolfe enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of fifteen, determined to become a playwright, but despite the success of his college productions, and later, the plays he wrote during his studies at Harvard University's renowned 47 Workshop, he was unable to interest professional New York producers in his work.Fearing penury and professional failure, Wolfe was encouraged to turn to the writing of fiction full-time by Aline Bernstein, a set designer for the New York Theatre Guild, with whom Wolfe carried on a five-year affair (and who appears in Wolfe's fiction as the Esther Jack character in The Web and the Rock (1939) and Of Time and the River .) Scribner's legendary Maxwell Perkins was the only editor to appreciate Wolfe's freshman effort, Look Homeward, Angel, and after extensive revisions and collaborative editing sessions, the novel was published in 1929. The largely autobiographical book was received with unequivocal enthusiasm. The residents of Asheville, however, the real-life denizens of this drab circumstance, rebelled against Wolfe's often scathing portrayal of his hometown. The public outcry was so great that Wolfe did not return to his hometown for seven years.Rewarded with commercial success and a Guggenheim Fellowship, Wolfe wrote a second autobiographical saga about the life of Eugene Gant, Of Time and the River , in which Eugene, an aspiring novelist, details his travels to Europe. This time, the critics were torn. Wolfe's apparent formlessness was both a constant source of delight and frustration to critics, many of whom felt that Wolfe was pioneering new literary ground, while others insisted that the overweening passion inherent in Wolfe's rambling narratives betrayed the author's immaturity and solipsism.Furthermore, Wolfe's intimate collaboration with his editor, Perkins, were often derided by contemporaries, who insisted that Wolfe's inability to master novelistic form without significant editorial assistance rendered him artistically deficient. The rancorous extent of the criticism led to Wolfe's eventual break with Perkins, and in 1927, Wolfe signed with Edward C. Aswell at Harper. Yet Aswell had no less significant a role in reshaping and trimming Wolfe's future works than Perkins did previously.The early part of 1938 found Wolfe in Brooklyn, this time writing with a new social agenda. Agreeing with some of his critics that his earlier work was indeed too egocentric, Wolfe rechristened Eugene Gant as George Monk Webber, and embarked on writing a new novel dedicated to exploring worldwide social and political ills. This mammoth undertaking, after gargantuan editorial efforts on the part of Aswell, would be published posthumously, and as two novels, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can't Go Home Again (1940), as well as The Hills Beyond (1941), a collection which contained short fiction, a play, and a novella. Wolfe's development as a novelist was truncated by his sudden death at the age of thirty-eight, yet the progression of his novels showcases Wolfe's ever-evolving capacities as a writer. Navigating his way from self-obsessed chronicler of his own adolescence to sophisticated assessor of the adolescence of America itself, Wolfe was a writer who grew up in step with the country that both made him and maddened him. He died in 1938..\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\t0The Drunken Beggar on HorsebackIt was the hour of twilight on a soft spring day toward the end of Aprilin the year of Our Lord 1929, and George Webber leaned his elbows on the sill of his back window and looked out at what he could see of New York. His eye took in the towering mass of the new hospital at the end of the block, its upper floors set back in terraces, the soaring walls salmon colored in the evening light. This side of the hospital, and directly opposite, was the lower structure of the annex, where the nurses and the waitresses lived. In the restof the block half a dozen old brick houses, squeezed together in a solid row, leaned wearily against each other and showed their backsides to him.The air was strangely quiet. All the noises of the city were muted here into a distant hum, so unceasing that it seemed to belong to silence. Suddenly, through the open windows at the front of the house came the raucous splutter of a truck starting up at the loading platform of the warehouse across the street. The heavy motor warmed up with a full-throated roar, then there was a grinding clash of gears, and George felt the old house tremble under him as the truck swung out into the street and thundered off. The noise receded, grew fainter,then faded into the general hum, and all was quiet as before.As George leaned looking out of his back window a nameless happiness welled within him and he shouted over to the waitresses in the hospital annex, who were ironing out as usual their two pairs of drawers and their flimsy little dresses. He heard, as from a great distance, the faint shouts of children playing in the streets, and, near at hand, the low voices of the people in the houses. He watched the cool, steep shadows, and saw how the evening fight was moving in the little squares of yards, each of which had in it something intimate, familiar, and revealing -- a patch of earth in which a pretty woman had been setting out flowers, working earnestly for hours and wearing a big straw hat and canvas gloves; a little plot of new-sown grass, solemnly watered every evening by a man with a square red face and a bald head; a tittle shed or playhouse or workshop for some business man's spare-time hobby; or a gay-painted table, some easy lounging chairs, and a huge bright-striped garden parasol to cover it, and a good-looking girl who had been sitting there all afternoon reading, with a coat thrown over her shoulders and a tall drink at her side.Through some enchantment of the quiet and the westering fight and the smell of April in the air, it seemed to George that he knew these people all around him. He loved this old house on Twelfth Street, its red brick walls, its rooms of noble height and spaciousness, its old dark woods and floors that creaked; and in the magic of the moment it seemed to be enriched and given a profound and lonely dignity by all the human beings it had sheltered in its ninety years. The house became like a living presence. Every object seemed to have an animate vitality of its own -- walls, rooms, chairs, tables, even a half wet bath towel hanging from the shower ring above the tub, a coat thrown down upon a chair, and his papers, manuscripts, and books scattered about the room in wild confusion.The simple joy he felt at being once more a part of such familiar things also contained an element of strangeness and unreality. With a sharp stab of wonder he reminded himself, as he had done a hundred times in the last few weeks, that he had really come home again-home to America, home to Manhattan's swarming rock, and home again to love; and his happiness was faintly edged with guilt when he remembered that less than a year before he had gone abroad in anger and despair, seeking to escape what now he had returned to.In his bitter resolution of that spring a year ago, he had wanted most of all to get away from the woman he loved. Esther Jack was much older than he, married and living with her husband and grown daughter. But she had given George her love, and given it so deeply, so exclusively, that he had come to feel himself caught as in a trap. It was from that he had wanted to escape-that and the shameful memory of their savage quarrels, and a growing madness in himself which had increased in violence as she had tried to hold him. So he had finally left her and fled to Europe. He had gone away to forget her, only to find that he could not; he had done nothing but think of her all the time. The memory of her rosy, jolly face, her essential goodness, her sure and certain talent, and all the hours that they had spent together returned to torture him with new desire and longing for her.Thus, fleeing from a love that still pursued him, he had become a wanderer in strange countries. He had traveled through England, France, and Germany, had seen countless new sights and people, and-cursing, whoring, drinking, brawling his way across the continent-had had his head bashed in, some teeth knocked out, and his nose broken in a beer-hall fight. And then, in the solitude of convalescence in a Munich hospital, lying in bed upon his back with his ruined face turned upward toward the ceiling, he had nothing else to do but think. There, at last, he had learned a little sense. There his madness had gone out of him, and for the first time in many years he had felt at peace within himself...\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\",\n",

In late 1942, marine fighter ace Clete Frade, Army demolitions engineer Anthony Pelosi and electronics wizard David Ettinger are sent by the OSS on a top-secret mission to neutral Argentina: destroy a merchant ship that has been supplying Nazi submarines and raiders. But the projected raid is only the tip of the novel\\'s iceberg. The U.S. is hoping that Clete will be able to influence his estranged father, an eminence grise in Argentine politics by the name of \"El Coronel\" Jorge Guillermo Frade, to throw his influence behind the Allies. Meanwhile, Luftwaffe ace Peter von Wachtstein heads to Buenos Aires to consolidate the Nazi position. The Frades are convincing central characters, whose developing father-son relationship anchors much of the novel\\'s plot. Griffin\\'s reconstruction of upper-class Argentine society in the 1940s provides an exotic and credible setting for a tautly written story whose twists and turns will keep readers guessing until the last page.

Lieut Clete Frade, a Marine fighter pilot, is pulled off Guadalcanal. He and a small team have been selected by the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, the allied intelligence group) to stop the Germans from using neutral Argentina to resupply. Clete\\'s father, who for complicated reasons he has never met, is a major figure in Argentina. Clete swiftly discerns that half his mission is to influence his estranged father in favor of the Allied cause; but working for the OSS, there are plots within plots.

Burgess, U.S. Army TRALINET Ctr., Fort Monroe, Va.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tThis rambling World War II novel pits U.S. Marine Captain Cletus Frade, late of Guadalcanal, against an ostensibly neutral ship in Buenos Aires in 1942. Naturally, the Nazis are angling for position in this vital South American port, and Clete\\'s mission is to maintain Allied influence with the Argentine navy by destroying the German-controlled ship. Along the way, Clete encounters the father he\\'s never met (now a top officer in the Argentine army), a sympathetic German Luftwaffe officer, and a beautiful Argentine \"virgin princess,\" with whom he falls in love. His accomplices include a Jew who escaped the Holocaust, an Italian American demolitions expert from Cicero, Illinois, and various members of the Office of Special Services, who may or may not be willing to sacrifice Clete\\'s life. Accomplished war novelist Griffin is a stickler for details, although several notable characters remain undeveloped (including the Jewish communications expert Ettinger and all of the women). The embryonic relationship between Clete and his long-lost officer dad seems genuine, but other relationships, such as between Clete and Luftwaffe Captain Peter von Wachstein, are forced. World War II buffs will enjoy the fresh setting even though neutral Argentina often seems about as cutting-edge as Switzerland, and the casual reader will find this lengthy book a surprisingly quick read aided by the abundance of dialogue.

       " 'B000FUTVLY': \"The sensuous thrill of ballroom dancing collides with the hip-hop world of self-expression in Take the Lead. Antonio Banderas (Desperado, The Mask of Zorro) stars as Pierre Dulaine, a dance teacher who--perhaps to fill a void in his own life--decides to teach the foxtrot and the tango to a group of inner-city high school students who've been put in detention. The kids sullenly resist this intruder with his silly box-steps, but gradually succumb to the allure of passion channeled into physical grace. It's a lot of hooey, of course--the stories about the individual kids are shallow melodrama--but a movie like this isn't so much about plot as about dancing, and the dancing bewitches. The main problem of Take the Lead is that there isn't enough dancing; at least half of the personal struggle of the students could be jettisoned and happily be replaced by fifteen minutes of a sleek and sexy rhumba. Still, Banderas has a warm, ingratiating presence and can spout platitudes about dance with conviction; Alfre Woodard (Crooklyn, Desperate Housewives) has her usual charismatic authority as the school's hard-nosed principal; and the dance competition at the movie's end gives the movie the lift it's wanted for the previous hour and a half. --Bret Fetzer\\tInspired by a true story, Antonio Banderas stars as internationally acclaimed ballroom dancer Pierre Dulane in the energetic and moving film Take The Lead. When Dulane volunteers to teach dance in the New York public school system, his background first clashes with his students' tastes...but together they create a completely new style of dance.DVD Features:Audio CommentaryMusic Clips\",\n",

       " '0385248946': \"The title of this absorbing new novel by the author of Honor at Daybreak refers to the extermination of the buffalo, which once roamed the American prairies in herds so vast that they covered miles of territory like carpets. The creature's days are numbered as the book opens, with the Civil War ended and the country again focused on Manifest Destiny. Thrown from a train in Kansas by irate victims of his prowess with cards, English gambler Nigel Smithwick is saved from death in the desert by former Confederate soldier Jeff Layne. The pair team up as buffalo hunters, and inevitably they clash with the Comanche Indians, whose traditional way of life is threatened by white hunters's mass killing. Kelton deftly handles both sides of the conflict, displaying a more-than-passing knowledge of Native American culture and eloquently capturing the post-Civil War tension between erstwhile northerners and southerners now making new lives in the West. Well written and fast-paced, this powerful, moving novel proceeds inexorably toward the extinction of the great herds and of the indigenous peoples' way of life. It will attract readers who enjoyed the epic sweep of such grand western sagas as Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove and Harry Combs's Brules.

       " '0201700549': 'Perlness  In the world of languages, the country of Perl is the great melting pot which welcomes all cultures, religions, and beliefs. Give me your tired, your poorly-supported programmers, your huddled masses yearning to be free of artificial limitations, says Perl, and those who land on its shores find an environment where they are no longer hampered by a language designer\\'s whimsical notions of elegant semantics and stifling syntactical purity.  Perl\\'s universal availability and ease-of-use make it the most democratic programming language. Unlike many other languages, a relative beginner can write useful programs, whereas effective programmers in other languages normally need to spend a lot longer to learn syntax, operators, and functions. A Perl programmer may possess such expertise, or may be a newcomer who modified some example script to perform a new function.  But the newcomer has another problem: lack of debugging skills. Experience forces the canny to develop an innate knack for debugging due to years of accumulated pain. We want to minimize that pain, because we have suffered it. Perl\\'s ease of use allows programmers with little knowledge to create usable, if fragile, code. The amount of time it takes to debug a Perl program can vary dramatically from person to person. Our goal is to help you minimize the development, debugging, and maintenance time you need for your own Perl programs.  Do not take the title of this book to imply we are debugging Perl itself in these pages. What few bugs exist in the Perl interpreter are a matter of minute exotica (or exotic minutiae), rapidly squashed by the fine volunteer crew supporting Perl. A more accurate title would have been Debugging Your Perl Programs, but that felt too pedestrian and loses the unplugged pun.  We wrote this book because we wanted you to see the development process at work. Most books on programming contain carefully crafted examples honed through sweaty practice to work perfectly and stand as mute testimonial to the elegant style of the author. They don\\'t show you the ugly, irritating process it took to get the examples into shape; yet those examples did not in fact spring into existence fully formed from the forehead of their creator. Because you will experience this same process when developing your programs, we want to guide you through it and describe various ways around the embarrassment, humiliation, and surprising pitfalls that stand between you and Great Programming.  Within this book, we describe the most common and annoying mistakes a new Perl programmer might make, and then detail the procedures to identify and correct those bugs and any others. You should have some knowledge of Perl; several fine tutorials exist to free us from the onerous responsibility of explaining scalars and arrays and hashes and the like. This preface includes a few references to some of the most useful of these tutorials.  We will not attempt to define or describe a proper programming style. Style is as unique as an individual--but a few general rules create a common reference so that we can easily read each other\\'s programs.  Neither is this a how to program book. Although we will probe into the mechanics and underpinnings of the general principle of programming at times, it is not our intention to inculcate a complete newcomer with the mindset of the programmer\\'s discipline.Who Are You?  If you\\'ve been programming in Perl anywhere from a week to a year and want to speed up your development cycle, this book is for you. We\\'ll also address some issues related to developing in a team. This book is intended to assist those who have started learning Perl by providing practical advice on development practices.What This Book Covers  Here\\'s what you\\'ll find in the rest of this book:   Chapter 1:  Introduction and a guided tour of the Perl documentation  Chapter 2:  Developing the right mindset for programming and developing effectively  Chapter 3:  Gotchas in Perl: Working your way around some of the tricky things to understand or get right in Perl programming  Chapter 4:  Antibugging: How to code defensively  Chapter 5:  How to instrument your code  Chapter 6:  How to test your Perl programs  Chapter 7:  A tour of the perl debugger: our guide to using this built-in tool  Chapter 8:  Types of  syntax error and how to track down their causes  Chapter 9:  Run-time errors  Chapter 10:  Semantical errors: When your program appears to work but doesn\\'t do the right thing  Chapter 11:  How to improve the performance of a resource-hungry (memory, CPU cycles, and so on) program  Chapter 12:  Tips and pitfalls for people coming to Perl from other languages  Chapter 13:  Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming: special tips for debugging this type of Perl program  Chapter 14:  Conclusion  Appendix A:  Reference for the Perl debugger commands  Appendix B:  List of our Perls of Wisdom   We will spend a lot of time going through examples of problems and how you might debug them.Getting Perl  While this isn\\'t a book about how to install or build perl,1 we owe you at least rudimentary instructions on how to get a perl of your own.   For Windows machines, get the free ActivePerl distribution:   activeState/ActivePerl/download.htm   For Macintoshes:   cpan/ports/index.html#mac   For binary distributions for all other machines:   cpan/ports/   For the source of perl itself:   cpan/src/Building perl from source on a supported Unix architecture requires just these commands after you download and unpack the right file:  ./Configure  make  make test  make install  # if the make test succeeds  The  Configure step asks you zillions of questions, and most people won\\'t have a clue what many of those questions are talking about; but the default answers  Configure recommends are usually correct.  For educational purposes, you may want to build a perl that has debugging enabled. (Here we refer to a perl that lets you use the special  -D flag to enable the output of information that tells you what perl is doing with your program. This has nothing to do with Perl\\'s built-in interactive debugger--which we discuss in Chapter 7--all perls have that.) If you want to do that, build perl from the source, and when  Configure asks,  Any additional cc flags?  paste in whatever it already shows between brackets as a default and add  -DDEBUGGING . See the  perlrun POD page (explained later) for more information.  We occasionally refer to modules that are not part of the core Perl distribution but that can be found on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).

The vast majority of what we say works unaltered on older versions of Perl 5, but not Perl 4. If you use any version of Perl older than 5.004_04, you should upgrade; 5.003 had issues such as security problems and memory leaks. You can find out the version number of your perl by passing it the  -v flag:  % perl -v  This is perl, v5.6.0 built for i586-linux  Copyright 1987-2000, Larry Wall  ...  Perl won\\'t execute a script named on the command line if the  -v flag is present. A more detailed description of your perl\\'s configuration can be obtained with the  -V flag; if you issue a bug report, the facility for doing that automatically includes this information with your report.  A separate development track exists for Perl; you will know if you have one of those versions because the release number either contains an underscore followed by a number of 50 or larger or contains an odd number between two dots. Nothing is guaranteed to work in such a distribution; it\\'s intended for testing. If you find you have one and you didn\\'t want it, the person who downloaded your perl probably visited the wrong FTP link.  It was announced at the fourth annual Perl Conference (Monterey, California, July 2000) that Perl  6 development was beginning in earnest, and backward compatibility need not stand in the way of doing good things. As of press time, discussion continues on new language features.0201700549P04062001\\t\"This book was a joy to read.

Focusing on debugging, the most vexing aspect of programming in Perl, this example-rich reference and how-to guide minimizes development, troubleshooting, and maintenance time resulting in the creation of elegant and error-free Perl code.  Designed for the novice to intermediate software developer, Perl Debugged will save the programmer time and frustration in debugging Perl programs. Based on the authors extensive experience with the language, this book guides developers through the entire programming process, tackling the benefits, plights, and pitfalls of Perl programming. Beginning with a guided tour of the Perl documentation, the book progresses to debugging, testing, and performance issues, and also devotes a chapter to CGI programming in Perl. Throughout the book, the authors espouse defensible paradigms for improving the accuracy and performance of Perl code. In addition, Perl Debugged includes Scott and Wrights Perls of Wisdom which summarize key ideas from each of the chapters, and an appendix containing a comprehensive listing of Perl debugger commands.  In this exceptional reference and debugging guide, the authors cover every aspect of efficient Perl programming, including:  * CGI programmingspecial tips for debugging this type of Perl program * How to develop the proper mindset for developing and programming effectively in Perl * Perl gotchashow to understand them, work around them, and avoid them * Antibuggingthe authors rules of thumb on how to code defensively * The Perl debugger the authors guide to using this Perl built-in * Common syntax errors and how to track down their causes * Semantical errorswhy code may appear correct but the programs do not work * How to improve the performance of resource-hungry programs * Tips and advice for programmers moving to Perl from other language environments Focusing on the process of Perl programming and guidelines for identifying and correcting mistakes, Perl Debugged helps the developer to write better Perl programs immediately and become better programmers in general.\\tEd Wright is a Software Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Bellman\\'s thesis in this slim, smart, plainspoken and occasionally overidealistic volume on embracing, in all their glory and nastiness, the organizations to which we\\'ve devoted our lives. In this way, we ennoble both them and ourselves. The first section of Bellman\\'s book aims to bring us to terms with everything we hate about organizations--be they corporate, institutional, governmental, or, um, our workplace--then urges us to look beneath the day-to-day workings of organizations and start imagining them at their full potential--what Bellman calls a quest for their \"beauty and life.\"  Part Three offers 20 \"renewal assertions\" for sparking change within organizations--on personal, small-group, and systemic levels--and the final section actually gives some fairly concrete steps for turning those assertions into action. Throughout the book, astute self-questions prompt the process of reconciliation with organizations (even though they sometimes sound scarily like New Age exercises for interpersonal growth: \"Describe your relationship with this organization as it has developed so far, beginning with awareness and moving toward love.\" Yikes!) There is much to recommend here, though. If Bellman\\'s style often evokes a gentle natured, Birkenstock-wearing family therapist, he does manage to lay out a clear path for rethinking and attempting organizational change without offering even one of those honeyed \"real-life snapshots\" that proliferate in this genre. That said, this book still seems best suited to those with the clout to effect change, be they CEOs, veeps, or even department supervisors. Bellman\\'s slightly wide-eyed promise that we can all transform the organizations we\\'re a part of if we only take a good, hard look at our own attitudes and assumptions seems oblivious of the fact that, usually, those most willing to give of themselves to an organization are already getting the most from it. In big organizations, as in dysfunctional families, sometimes the love you take just isn\\'t equal to the love you make. --Timothy Murphy\\t\"Geoff Bellman has a reverence for what is good about organizations, plus revolutionary thinking about how they could better perform nowand in the future.

This middle-aged Good Samaritan hires Olympia to assist him as a nurse, and their collaboration soon evolves into a fiery love affair. Alas, it\\'s only a matter of weeks before this passionate exercise in managed care is exposed--with disastrous consequences for the young, impregnated heroine. Even her adoring father now considers her \"an overplump sixteen-year-old girl whose judgment can no longer be trusted,\" and insists that she break off her relationship:  \"There is nothing more to be said on this subject,\" he says. She bites her lip to keep from crying out further. She holds the arms of her chair so tightly she later will have cramps in her fingers. She will refuse to obey him, she thinks. She will accept his implied challenge and set off on her own. But in the next moment, she asks herself: How will she be able to do that? Without her father\\'s support, she cannot hope to survive.

The author did some meticulous research for her New England background, which gives this study of one particular wayward woman some extra historical heft. Some readers may find the plot twists a bit pat.

It\\'s summer, and the Biddefords have moved for the season into their New Hampshire seaside cottage, which was once a convent. It faces the treacherous coast, which gives the place (and Shreve\\'s novel) its haunting name, and this setting, just like every other seemingly casual detail, presages the high drama to come. It begins when Olympia suddenly senses that she is no longer a child. Even her father, who has been home-schooling her, detects something different about his smart and beautiful daughter as he instructs her to read a book of socially conscious essays written by Dr. John Haskell, who, along with his wife and children, will be their dinner guest. Olympia evinces no interest until she and Haskell--41, handsome, and intense--come face-to-face and are shot through with that awful current that signals love-at-first-sight. Their reckless affair precipitates a scandal of immense proportions, resulting in a harrowing separation and pregnancy. As sexy as their taboo liaisons are, Shreve is just as compelling in her descriptions of Olympia\\'s solitary suffering in their aftermath, and in the rousing courtroom scenes that pave the way for a morally triumphant happy ending. This is exceptionally fine entertainment.  Donna Seaman\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tShreves seventh novel (Pilots Wife, 1998, etc.) is a pleasantly atmospheric fin-de-sicle tale of high-society adultery, in which love ultimately triumphs for a gorgeously written heroine who seems to belong in a different century. At a time when women dont show their ankles in public, Olympia Biddeford embarks on a summer 1899 idyll on the New Hampshire shore. With grace and understatement, Shreve evokes 15-year-old Olympias emerging sexuality, her family cottage on Fortunes Rocks, and the bright, sea-clean season. The perfect complement to the heroine\\'s enchanted world is Dr. John Haskell, a physician and writer who provides care to the poor of a nearby mill town. Despite his wife and children, Haskell and Olympia fall in love and are soon caught in flagrante. Disgraced, the Biddeford family leaves Fortunes Rocks for Boston, where Olympia discovers she is pregnant. She gives birth, the child is taken to an orphanage, and Olympia is exiled to a western Massachusetts convent. Olympia eventually returns to the cottage at Fortunes Rocks to rebuild her life. She seeks out and finds her lost son, and files a suit to recover him. The trial (a very \\'90s concoction, with ethnic and class conflict at its heart) is stirring, and though Olympia winsthe adoptive parents are too grubby to raise the boy correctlyshe refuses the victory when she sees their pain. Haskell returns from his exile in the West, where he has been treating immigrants and Native Americans, to find Olympias love for him still strong. They marry, and, sensing the distant strains of political correctness, convert the cottage into a birthing center for unmarried women. Olympia leaps out in sharp focus from the first page, but the conscientiously tangled plotting and the muddle it provokes in her show the strain of transplanting a millenial sensibility back a hundred years.($200,000 ad/promo; author tour)  -- Copyright 1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Biddefords\\' turn-of-the-century world of scholarship and privilege is fluidly depicted by Blair Brown\\'s narration. Her voice is gentle, yet easily captures Olivia\\'s impetuousness and passion throughout the story. The stylized formality of the period, its customs and speech seem natural and without artifice. Brown\\'s performance isn\\'t overly sentimental and plays to the heart of the story, to Olivia\\'s strength, her independence and its consequences. The production is carefully orchestrated in pace and mood. Side breaks and changes of scene show the expert hand of director Lars Hoel.  R.F.W.

       " '0024089400': 'A native of St. Louis, Missouri,  Robert M. Seltzer  is an associate professor of history at Hunter College of the City University of New York, where he teaches Jewish history and is coordinator of the interdisciplinary program in Jewish studies. He taught previously in the department of Religious Thought at the University of Pennsylvania. He holds degrees from Washington University, Yale University, the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and Columbia University, and has studied at Harvard University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He has published scholarly papers on the rise of Jewish nationalism, on the eminent Russian Jewish historian Simon Dubnow, and on the history of the Jews in Eastern Europe.\\tLike every distinctive heritage, Judaism must be understood as a creative response to ultimate issues of human concern by members of a group that has faced a unique concatenation of political, economic, and geographical circumstances. And the Jewish historical experience is more unusual than most. Standing both within and without the mainstream of Western culture, Judaism offers remarkable insights into the genesis and elaboration of powerful religious ideas and into the determined survival of a small, vulnerable people repeatedly forced to confront and adjust to conditions beyond its immediate control.    In this work, I have attempted to survey the Jewish historical landscape and orient the reader to its main features, opening up for him access to the rich scholarly literature on Jewish history, theology, philosophy, mysticism, and social thought that has been produced in the last century and a half. The subject of every section of every chapter involves the lifework of several researchers. Within the limits of the space available to me I have tried to provide a reasonably detailed introduction to a complex, ramified, and intellectually challenging field of humanistic learning.    The structure and contents of this book have been affected by the following considerations. First, I felt that it was necessary to include enough general historic4-background that the reader could glimpse the larger context in which each new phase of Judaism emerged out of previous phases. The separateness of Judaism has always been relative rather than absolute. The overall political and social milieu and the spiritual climate have shaped, sometimes subtly and sometimes conspicuously, the Jewish condition. Jewry has responded selectively and according to its own criteria of meaning and value to events affecting non-Jews as well; Judaism, at the same time, has exerted a reciprocal influence, direct or indirect, on the general course of historical development. It is always necessary to adjust the usual rubrics of history, such as ancient, medieval, and modern, to the particular contours of Jewish identity to define the changing subjective borders between Jew and non-Jew. Thus, it was a crucial transition when Judaism passed from being the only monotheistic civilization in a polytheistic world to being the monotheism of a minority living in lands where the state religions of the Christian or Muslim majority were spiritual descendants of Judaism; and it was another crucial transition when the secularization of European society set in motion a variety of contradictory redefinitions of the status and core of modern Jewish identity. Second, I have tried to avoid falsifying the nature of Jewish history through oversimplification. The social profile and institutional structure of Jewry have been modified to such an extent in the course of centuries that no single definition of the Jews in a few words is possible, except that they are the continuation of previous Jewish generations. Emerging from a collectivity of seminomadic clans and tribes, the Jews during some periods were mainly peasants and fighters; in later periods they have been predominately urban artisans and merchants, sometimes widely scattered in small villages and towns, sometimes concentrated in a few geographical regions or in the major cities of the world. There have been centuries when Jewish identity was primarily an unquestioned matter of descent, and ages when proselytes have been enthusiastically sought or when positive Jewish loyalty involved a strong element of personal choice. Discrimination, hatred, and violence against Jews have marked certain epochs, alternating with times of relative security when there were some tangible, as well as psychological, advantages of belonging to the Jewish minority. For over 1,500 years Jewry was rooted in its original homeland (surely the return of a large proportion of modern Jews to that homeland is one of the most striking chapters in the history of any people), yet there is hardly any part of the world that has not seen one or more waves of Jewish settlement. Owing to the adaptability of Judaism, centrifugal tendencies of diaspora produced regional varieties of Jewish custom and cultureonly to have other, centripetal, forces bring these separate Jewish ethnicities together into crucibles where new forms of Jewishness emerged. And in the course of history the Jewish people has had various, quite different political and intellectual elites: monarchs and ethnarchs, priests and sages, scholars and elected communal officials. The survival of the Jewish group has been the triumph of continuity over periodic sometimes drastic, change.    Third, I have tried to indicate that the intellectual history of the Jewish people exhibits a complexity similar to that of its social history. The character of Jewish thoughtwhether it was innovative or conservative, whether it took a collective or individualistic form of expressionhas been a function of the nature of Jewish society at the time, of the presence or absence of internal sectarian or political controversy, and of the roles that Jewish writers, sages, and intellectuals projected for themselves with respect to the people and God. Jewish intellectual history embraces periods of conscious encounter with the most sophisticated general modes of philosophical and scientific thought and eras of relative intellectual isolation when Jewish legal, theological, and mystical preoccupations do not correspond in any obvious way to those of adjacent cultures. In certain centuries some Jewish intellectuals have enthusiastically adapted rationalism to the defense of their faith, whereas their contemporaries or successors rejected rationalism as undermining religion and threatening the integrity of the Jewish tradition. I have tried to describe most of the principal modes of thought that have been called Jewish by Jews, so that the reader can gain an overall and representative conception of the subtraditions of Judaism and their outstanding individual exemplars. But there is a unity with the diversity of Jewish thought. The Jewish intellectual heritage is not merely a sequence of writings produced by Jews, but a consideration of issues arising out of the biblical world view, augmented and reshaped by later concerns and partaking in a self-transforming unity of themes, symbols, and beliefs. The convictions that there is only one God who created the universe and who guides history, that He commands justice and mercy, and that Israel is His people provide the starting points and focus of Jewish religious thought throughout most of history and affect secular Jewishness in the modern world as well.    Above all, it has been the aim of this book to address itself to one of the greatest puzzles facing the modern student: that Jewish history is at the same time an account of a people and a religiona very unusual people and a religion exactly like no other, both of which have to be understood according to their own dynamics and their own categories. The overarching unity of the societal and the ideational poles of Jewish historical experience seems to me to require that each be treated in some detail. Neither a history of the Jewish people that mentions only in passing the greatest Jewish thinkers nor a history of Jewish thought that is forced to omit much of the Jewish historical continuum, conveys the rich uniqueness of Jewish identity. A grasp of the interrelationship of these two levels of the common denominator \"Jewish\" should accompany the reader\\'s exploration of particular phases and elements of Jewish history. It is crucial in an introductory survey to exhibit the interplay between the body and the mind of Judaism, because, in the long run, the social shaped the ideational and the ideational shaped the social in surprising ways.    A brief explanation of some specific choices I have made in the process of writing this book: For practical and historical reasons, I decided to present the Bible according to its traditional format, not according to the preliminary oral or literary phases that were absorbed into the final text. Familiarity with the Bible can not be taken for granted in a beginning study of Judaism, and a description of the contents of the principal biblical bookswith historical explanations and flashbacks in passingseemed useful. Moreover, it was the Bible as a whole, not its earlier components, that became the groundwork for the development of Judaism in subsequent periods. Second, I have tried to convey, when dealing with certain formative periods of Judaism such as the rise of monotheism end the religious ferment of the first century BCE and the first century CE, the awareness that limited and uncertain data make every reconstruction conjectural and a subject of considerable scholarly dispute. Third, I regret that limitation of space prevented more extended treatment of certain topics, but I wanted to concentrate on those intellectual movements, such as philosophy and mysticism, which, in the long run, represent the most self-conscious speculation on the truth of Judaism, and it was imperative that they be presented with adequate scope. Finally, a word on why I devoted so much attention to modern Jewish secular thought. I believe that Jewish secularism has features that differentiate it from secularism in general and make it a reexamination, from a new perspective, of the meaning of Jewish existence. Secular Zionism has been, of course, one of the most vital movements of modern Jewish renewal and its diagnosis of the Jewish predicament cannot be ignored. No one can describe Judaism, especially its recent trends, without assumptions and a position of his own, but I hope that mine are sufficiently inclusive and catholic not to distort unfairly any of the movements I have portrayed. It is my conviction, however, that the future of Judaism as a coherent world view, and therefore as an identity with continued personal relevance, involves philosophical and theological exploration of the kind indicated in the last chapter.    I would like to record my ...',\n",

       " '0385485557': 'Mahfouz\\'s first nonfiction book to be published in English, this mosaic of autobiographical vignettes, reflections, allegories, childhood memories, dream visions and Sufi-like spiritual maxims and paradoxes is a deep pool of wisdom that confirms his stature as a writer of universal appeal. These short forms seem to come naturally to the Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian novelist, a master of chiseled prose, pithy observations and devastating asides. As the title suggests, this compilation echoes his recurring themes: the common humanity of rich and poor, the redemptive power of love, the transitoriness of happiness, the yearning of salvation, and how our inevitable destiny, death, unconsciously molds our strivings and search for meaning. In her introductory essay, Gordimer defends Mahfouz against feminists who attack his depiction of women characters, arguing that he accurately portrays the oppression of women in his society. By contrast, the women in these parables and sketches, though often impersonally observed, are symbols of spiritual release, radiant joy, beauty and freedom. There are scattered, veiled political echoes, too, as in the first-person portrait of an elementary school pupil who secretly longs for anarchy and revolution. Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t\"Do you deny that you had your share of the warmth of the world and its fragrance?\" one interloper asks the elderly, often weary narrator in one of the series of allegorical reflections that frame the life of the Egyptian Nobel laureate (e.g., Children of the Alley, LJ 12/95). Mahfouz transcends the traditional autobiography here, offering instead distillations of an impossibly full and eventful career. The brief anecdotes recall the narrator\\'s youth, a time \"pure and unsullied\"; temptation and longing to return to the embrace of family; dreams; fears of lost esteem and fallen glory; and sensuous epiphanies. A particular light, aroma, or tune will recall for the narrator, now in old age and hounded by death, snatches of a time he despairs of repossessing. Mahfouz surrenders the last quarter of this slim volume to the pithy parables of the sheikhs?as if to signal the end (\"What I endured from desire made my life a yearning concealed in nostalgia\"). Mahfouz\\'s language carries the gravity of religious truth and the lyrical clarity of poetry. An enigmatic work that will please his growing numbers of American readers.?Amy Boaz, \"Library Journal\"Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tSince winning the Nobel Prize in 1988, Mahfouz has garnered a considerable American following. The latest book of the prolific Egyptian novelist and short story writer to appear here, a special little volume most meaningful to those who have enjoyed his fiction, is a series of autobiographical sketches, each approximately a half page in length but some only two or three lines long. As she trenchantly states in her beautiful foreword, South African writer Nadine Gordimer finds these \"aphorisms, parables, [and] allegories\" to be \"meditations which echo that which was, has been, and is the writer, Mahfouz.\" In pondering the emotional effects of childhood disease, the execution of a friend for murder, or the nature of time, Mahfouz is not always writing directly about his past; in many instances, he is simply sharing wise words to live by. Each of these pieces is a brilliantly polished gem that, taken together, form an iridescent mosaic.  Brad Hooper\\tAmericans accustomed to the histrionic self-display of celebrity memoirs and the self-involved, studied impressionism of writers\\' self-portraits are likely to find Nobel laureate Mahfouz\\'s fragmentary approach to autobiography charmingly novel. In fact, Mahfouz\\'s volume would be unrecognizable as autobiography to Western readers if it weren\\'t for its title. Instead of presenting a straightforward narrative about his family in Cairo, his philosophical studies, his career in the civil service, and his 34 novels (Children of the Alley, 1996, etc.), Mahfouz collects 200 terse memories, parables, fictions, and fugitive moments, some narrated in the first person, some in the third, most no more than a few sentences long. Many of them read like distillations of the longer fables in Arabian Nights and Days (1995). A nine-month-old fetus worries about the dim prospect of an afterlife. A billiard player, refusing a game, says he prefers to play alone as others watch him, even though everyone else in the parlor is asleep. A man bothered by a commotion in the street stops trying to quiet the carousers when he suddenly sees them ``in God\\'s good time, as they hurried toward the grave.\\'\\' An old man and his wife recall how ``they were brought together by love 30 years ago, then it had abandoned them along with the rest of their expectations.\\'\\' The majority of the characters here pass briefly and are gone, hustling off on their errands. Only one figure abides: Sheik Abd-Rabih al Ta\\'ih, whose Sufi-tinged apothegms on time and age, the ripeness of memory, the everlasting pursuit of love, and the shaping forces of death and faith (``There is no one more foolish than the foolish believer, except for the foolish unbeliever\\'\\') dominate the last third of the book.

Of his many works, most famous is The Cairo Trilogy, consisting of Palace Walk (1956), Palace of Desire (1957), and Sugar Street (1957), which focuses on a Cairo family through three generations, from 1917 until 1952. In 1988, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer in Arabic to do so. He died in August 2006.From the Trade Paperback edition.',\n",

Taking readers from sixth century bards St. Columba and Aneirin through King James I, Robbie Burns and Sir Walter Scott to Carol Ann Duffy and Meg Bateman, The New Penguin Book of Scottish Verse covers a 1,500-year, multilingual (Latin, Scots, Gaelic, English) tradition, with poems published in their original languages, along with English verse translations where necessary. St. Andrews University professor of Modern Scottish literature Robert Crawford (Spirit Machines) and Times Literary Supplement poetry editor Mick Imlah (Birthmarks) made the selections. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tAs the first volume to provide a historically broad overview of  the Scottish poetical tradition from the sixth to the end of the  20th centuries, this will be a welcome addition to larger poetry  collections, adding to the diversity of their ethnically based  survey anthologies. The editors, both poets themselves,  celebrate the multiplicity of languages in which poems from the  territories that would become modern Scotland were written and  recited by providing the original and then a parallel text in  English. In addition, poems presented in Scots are fully  glossed. A brief introduction offers a taste of the delights to  come, while biographical notes and an index of first lines give  added accessibility. The format of this collection allows  accessibility for the general reader, while its depth provides a  good starting point for those with a more academic interest in  the history of Scottish verse.

Wilder returns to his native Belfast and joins forces with his rebellious cousin. Reason is hired to renovate the West Belfast hospital where Wilder works.

Loud Guitars, pounding drums and an energetic front man have been the tools used to blaze a fan frenzied trail from one end of the US to the other.  Having grown tired of seeing \"cookie cutter\" bands staring at their shoes and boring audiences, guitarist Blake Baumeier and vocalist Cameron Flener decided to bring back the performance elements of rock music that seemed to have been so sadly forgotten.  \"The Velcro Pygmies are the old Van Halen for a new generation\" states Flener, the charismatic son of a Baptist minister. Prowling the stage with a \"six-pack\" stomach, Flener invokes the spirits of a bygone era of Rock. Controlling the crowd like a demented Aerobics instructor, Cameron never fails to bring the audience to a boil!  \"When I go see a band, I don\\'t want to be disappointed\", adds Baumeier, \"I want to see a show, and that\\'s what we want to give people!\" The lanky guitarist serves as the group\\'s main songwriter and musical director. \"Someone\\'s got to be sane...\" deadpans the musician affectionately referred to by his fans as \"The Blazeman\". \"Standing on the Pygmie\\'s stage is no easy task\", claims Blake, \"There\\'s a lot going on...if you\\'re not confident, you\\'ll get lost in the shuffle!\"  Finding the right members to fill out this lineup was no easy task, however drummer Chris Eddins proved to be the perfect man for the job. It\\'s impossible to describe the onstage antics of the Pygmie percussionist: balancing sticks on his nose, kicking cymbals, and spinning drumsticks in every direction. His \"you\\'ve got to see it to believe it\" ability has made Chris a crowd favorite. Being one of the world\\'s most influential drummers has also landed Chris endorsement deals with DW Drums and Sabian Cymbals...as well as his own signature razor!  Bassist Jimmy Mullin rounds out the group with handsome features, great vocals and no nonsense rock and roll low end. Always smiling, Jimmy has firmly set his feet on a stage that would eat most players alive. \"I enjoy being a part of the show as much as the audience does\", quips Jimmy!  With the experience of over a thousand shows under their belts, the Velcro Pygmies are conquering the world like a Rock and Roll army. Cam\\'s ability to bring a crowd to life, Blake\\'s straight ahead guitar and sense of humor, Chris\\' circus-like skills, and Jimmy\\'s powerful bass playing have molded this act into one of the most sought-after bands in the country! The Velcro Pygmies combination of four-part harmonies, catchy songs, and expert playing ability could make them the next Rock and Roll Legend to grow from the Heartland of America!\\tVelcro Pygmies are the epitome of what Southern Rock is all about.

Sunita, a former law student and activist,  has  married her university sweetheart Akash, and is settled into a life of  overweight, underappreciated motherhood. Tania is a raven-maned beauty who\\'s  rejected marriage and anything traditionally Asian for a high-flying TV career  and a compliant Indophile boyfriend. And then there\\'s Chila. Innocent, kind, funny Chila, with her simple soul and her glass animal collection, has just, to everyone\\'s amazement, snared Deepak--the \"most eligible  bachelor within a twenty-mile radius.\"  A comedienne and actress as well as the author of the prize-winning  Anita and Me, Syal expertly steers her characters through what we might call middle youth--that emotional roller coaster of an age when the real growing up  is done. Everywhere her trademark wit and sensitivity are on display.  There\\'s the inevitable bitching at the wedding: \"Now the sister is howling. I\\'d howl if I had a moustache like hers...\" Then, after the ceremony, come the traditional tears:  Tissue-clutching matriarchs reattached themselves to harrumphing  husbands, reaffirming their bonds to each other and the watching world. Single  girls clucked in feverish groups, high on the drama of the departure, tossing their fancy dupattas at the single men, torn between the horror and the longing of it all.  What comes after that, alas, is infidelity and envy and  betrayal. True to its stoic title, Life Isn\\'t All Ha Ha Hee Hee  encompasses not only the strengths but the limits of female friendship. Yet the  author retains her sense of humor and cross-cultural irony to the very end.  One final note: if you\\'re pregnant and have set your heart on natural childbirth, avoid pages 72 and 73. Or else book that elective cesarean  and painkilling cocktail. Now. --Lisa Gee\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tThe multitalented Syal, an award-winning TV/screenwriter and U.K. actress, tells a compassionate, resonant tale of culture clash, Indian identity and friendship in her smoothly executed second novel (her first, Anita and Me, won a Betty Trask Award and was shortlisted for the Guardian Fiction Prize). With spot-on cinematic sensibility and laugh-out-loud dialogue, Syal charts the lives of three 30-something Indian women, friends since childhood, living in contemporary London. Sunita, a former activist law student, is a depressed, overweight housewife and mother of two, and Tania has rejected the traditional arranged marriage for a high-powered career in TV, an apartment in trendy Soho and a Caucasian live-in boyfriend. Chila, whom the other two consider simple, is marrying Deepak, \"bagging not only a groom with his own teeth, hair, degree and house, but the most eligible bachelor within a 20-mile radius.\" All three women struggle with living in two cultures: the Indian world in which a woman\\'s worth is largely measured by her husband\\'s stature, and modern British culture, where self-realization and careerism dominate. Told from alternating points of view, the novel describes, with clarity and resonance, the cultural collision that occurs when Tania makes a brash documentary on relationships, using her friends as subjects and presenting them in an unflattering light. After an incident between Tania and Deepak at the screening inflames the situation, the trio\\'s lifelong friendship is further imperiled. Syal handles many serious issues, including a death, a birth, a kidnapping and an extramarital affair or two, with wit and precision. A kind of Bridget Jones\\' Diary meets The Buddha of Suburbia, the novel poignantly captures the core of its characters with lusty brio and keen intelligence. 5-city author tour.

A documentary featuring their \"happy\" marriages reveals truths that they are not prepared to face, challenging the foundation of their long friendships. Syal\\'s comedic talent is obvious, as is her capacity (as a British-born Indian) to look honestly at urban Indian life and comment on how second-generation Indians in London cope with the challenge of dual cultures. Her novel is refreshing in that it does not exoticize Indian life or present stereotypes of Indian women. Recommended for major public libraries, especially those serving diverse, multicultural populations; libraries with women\\'s collections will also want this book as an example of the new writing emerging from women of color.DZaheera Jiwaji, Edmonton, Alberta Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHardcover\\t edition.\\tThree women, close friends, have braided lives in this ripe story: gorgeous Tania, whose wit and steely reserve serve her well in her media career; gentle, openhearted Chila, for whom niceness is a way of life; and Sunita, who has gone from feminist activist to overweight housewife in a breath. Although the tropes of boyfriends, husbands, and yammering parents and the intense demands of children are familiar, the subject and setting--Indian-Brit families in contemporary England--offers a rich ethnic twist. Tania makes a documentary based on her friends\\' lives. The truths she reveals there, in the hidden gestures and smoothed-over anguish, explode their close relationships and expose the stress fractures in the two marriages and in Tania\\'s relationship with her English boyfriend. The scene where Sunita\\'s husband drinks himself into a stupor while secretly reading her annotations to a book on Indian sexuality is hilarious and deeply discomfiting.

       " 'B0000060KC': 'The first new recording of Vaughan Williams\\'s magnificent Mass in G  Minor in more than 10 years, this version from the Chicago-based His  Majestie\\'s Clerkes ensemble goes to the top of the list for its exceptional  sound and for its solid, thoroughly musical performances. The program is filled  out with first-rate renditions of Sir Charles Villiers Stanford\\'s exquisite Op.  38 motets--favorites of choirs and audiences from the minute they were written-- and Hubert Parry\\'s six Songs of Farewell, whose superbly crafted part- writing combines perfectly with the romanticized spirituality of the texts.  Except for a brief lapse of intonation in the Vaughan Williams--not unusual even  for the finest choirs--these are exemplary performances that make a good case  for tempos generally more brisk than we may have heard before. --David  Vernier\\t. . . Immaculate discipline, radiant purity and expressive  fervour. Impeccable production values add to the very real attractions of  this Cedille release. -- GramophoneHis Majestie\\'s Clerkes . . . sing this stuff the way it was meant  to be sung. --  American Record GuideThis is a cappella choral singing at its best. -- The Laser Disc Gazette\\tSince 1982, His Majestie\\'s Clerkes has brought choral music,  both familiar and unusual, to Illinois audiences in performances of the  highest caliber. Although most of its repertory is a cappella, the group  has enjoyed successful collaborations with period-instrument ensembles  including the Newberry Consort, Orpheus Band, and Chicago Baroque Ensemble.  His Majestie\\'s Clerkes\\' concert series is now in its seventeenth year. The  ensemble has also made guest appearances for the American Musicological  Society, Performing Arts Chicago, Early Music from the Newberry Library,  the American Choral Directors Association, and the Stratford-upon-Avon  Music Festival. His Majestie\\'s Clerkes has brought to Chicago distinguished  guest conductors Sir David Willcocks, Simon Preston, Paul Hillier, David  Hill, and Alice Parker.  The ensemble has been recorded for broadcast numerous times by Chicago Fine  Arts Station WFMT-FM and by National Public Radio\\'s Performance Today. The  Clerkes\\' recordings for the Cedille, Centaur, Harmonia Mundi, and Narada  Media labels have garnered widespread acclaim in national and international  journals. The group has been a regular winner of grants from the National  Endowment for the Arts, the Illinois Arts Council, and the Chicago  Department of Cultural Affairs. The Clerkes\\' dedication to 20th-century  music has led them to commission and premier works by several contemporary  composers including Frank Ferko, Daniel Tucker, and Eric Reese.  A founding singer in His Majestie\\'s Clerkes, Anne Heider became the group\\'s  Artistic Director in 1989. Heider\\'s expertise in historical performance  practices, a cappella repertory, and choral blend have shaped the  ensemble\\'s distinctive sound. Heider holds a B.A. in music history and  theory from Wellesley College, an M.A. in musicology from New York  University, and a D.M.A. in conducting from Stanford University. She is  Associate Professor of Choral Music and Director of Choral Ensembles at  Chicago\\'s Roosevelt University, where she teaches choral conducting and  choral literature. Her research in early music has been supported by the  Newberry Library, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and Roosevelt  University, and her editions of early music have been published by A-R  Editions and the Gregorian Institute of America.\\tThe mixed choir His Majestie\\'s Clerkes takes listeners to the  heights of tonal beauty on this CD of rarely recorded, a capella music by  three English Romantic composers of the early twentieth century -- Vaughan  Williams, Stanford, and Parry. Best known to most concertgoers as a symphonist, Vaughan Williams is  represented by a large-scale work for chorus, his Mass in G Minor (1922).  The Chicago Tribune described the Clerkes\\' 1997 concert performance of this  work as \"rapt, strikingly beautiful . . . a genuinely moving experience.\"  Sir Richard Terry, director of the Westminster Cathedral Choir and leader  of the English a capella revival, called Vaughan Williams\\' mass \"one of the  greatest choral works of the century\" for its fiery intensity and  devotional spirit. Stanford\\'s complete Three Motets, Op. 38, includes the beloved,  oft-performed Beati quorum via, familiar to choral audiences and singers  alike. On the new CD, listeners have the rare opportunity to hear the Beati  along with its companion works, Justorum animae, and Coelos ascendit  hodie. Parry\\'s six searching, elegiac Songs of Farewell \"represent his art at its  deepest,\" notes The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs -- especially the  poignantly intense and beautiful harmonies of At the round earth\\'s imagined  corners. The songs, based on Biblical psalms and English poems, are  considered Parry\\'s most inspired works. In the CD notes, Anne Heider, the  Clerkes\\' artistic director, observes, \"The motets have a crescendo of  texture, from four parts in the opening work to five, six, seven, and  finally eight parts in the last, and a concomitant crescendo of emotional  intensity, culminating in the anguished searching of Psalm 39 [\"Lord, let  me know mine end\"].\"',\n",

       " 'B000N8TVAE': \"Diamond Clarity: No two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.Diamond Color:Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side. Diamond Carat Weight:A diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.Diamond Certification:A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details. Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.Our Diamond Policy:Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.Diamond Care:Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.

In The Maltese Falcon, the best known of Hammett\\'s Sam Spade novels (including The Dain Curse and The Glass Key), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment. Spade\\'s partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can\\'t provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade\\'s solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed. Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the movie, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman \"Angel\" and convince her that she is.

He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereaftermessenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkertons Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In The Maltese Falcon (1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade. The Thin Man (1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles. Red Harvest (1929), The Dain Curse (1929), and The Glass Key (1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammetts later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story Tulip, which is contained in the posthumous collection The Big Knockover (1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories, The Continental Op (1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the Op, a nameless detective (or operative) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled molda bit like Hammett himself.\\t      --This text refers to an alternate \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\tSamuel Spade\\'s jaw was long and bony, his chin a jutting v under the more flexible v of his mouth. His nostrils curved back to make another, smaller, v. His yellow-grey eyes were horizontal. The v motif was picked up again by thickish brows rising outward from twin creases above a hooked nose, and his pale brown hair grew down-- from high flat temples--in a point on his forehead. He looked rather pleasantly like a blond satan.He said to Effie Perine: \\'Yes, sweetheart?She was a lanky sunburned girl whose tan dress of thin woolen stuff clung to her with an effect of dampness. Her eyes were brown and playful in a shiny boyish face. She finished shutting the door behind her, leaned against it, and said: There\\'s a girl wants to see you. Her name\\'s Wonderly.A customer?I guess so. You\\'ll want to see her anyway: she\\'s a knockout.Shoo her in, darling, said Spade. Shoo her in.Effie Perine opened the door again, following it back into the outer office, standing with a hand on the knob while saying: Will you come in, Miss Wonderly?A voice said, Thank you, so softly that only the purest articulation made the words intelligible, and a young woman came through the doorway. She advanced slowly, with tentative steps, looking at Spade with cobalt-blue eyes that were both shy and probing.She was tall and pliantly slender, without angularity anywhere. Her body was erect and high-breasted, her legs long, her hands and feet narrow. She wore two shades of blue that had been selected because of her eyes. The hair curling from under her blue hat was darkly red, her full lips more brightly red. White teeth glistened in the crescent her timid smile madeSpade rose bowing and indicating with a thick-fingered hand the oaken armchair beside his desk. He was quite six feet tall. The steep rounded slope of his shoulders made his body seem almost conical--no broader than it was thick--and kept his freshly pressed grey coat from fitting very well.Miss Wonderly murmured, Thank you, softly as before and sat down on the edge of the chair\\'s wooden seat.Spade sank into his swivel-chair, made a quarter-turn to face her, smiled politely. He smiled without separating his lips. All the v\\'s in his face grew longer.The tappity-tap-tap and the thin bell and muffled whir of Effie Perine\\'s typewriting came through the closed door. Somewhere in a neighboring office a power-driven machine vibrated dully. On Spade\\'s desk a limp cigarette smoldered in a brass tray filled with the re-mains of limp cigarettes. Ragged grey flakes of cigarette-ash dotted the yellow top of the desk and the green blotter and the papers that were there. A buff-curtained window, eight or ten inches open, let in from the court a current of air faintly scented with ammonia. The ashes on the desk twitched and crawled in the current.Miss Wonderly watched the grey flakes twitch and crawl. Her eyes were uneasy. She sat on the very edge of the chair. Her feet were flat on the floor, as if she were about to rise. Her hands in dark gloves clasped a flat dark handbag in her lap.Spade rocked back in his chair and asked: Now what can I do for you, Miss Wonderly?She caught her breath and looked at him. She swallowed and said hurriedly: Could you--? I thought--I--that is-- Then she tortured her lower lip with glistening teeth and said nothing. Only her dark eyes spoke now, pleading.Spade smiled and nodded as if he understood her, but pleas-antly, as if nothing serious were involved. He said: Suppose you tell me about it, from the beginning, and then we\\'ll know what needs doing. Better begin as far back as you can.That was in New York.Yes.I don\\'t know where she met him. I mean I don\\'t know where in New York. She\\'s five years younger than I--only seventeen--and we didn\\'t have the same friends. I don\\'t suppose we\\'ve ever been as close as sisters should be. Mama and Papa are in Europe. It would kill them. I\\'ve got to get her back before they come home.Yes, he said.They\\'re coming home the first of the month.Spade\\'s eyes brightened. Then we\\'ve two weeks, he said.I didn\\'t know what she had done until her letter came. I was frantic. Her lips trembled. Her hands mashed the dark handbag in her lap. I was too afraid she had done something like this to go to the police, and the fear that something had happened to her kept urging me to go. There wasn\\'t anyone I could go to for advice. I didn\\'t know what to do. What could I do?Nothing, of course, Spade said, but then her letter came?Yes, and I sent her a telegram asking her to come home. I sent it to General Delivery here. That was the only address she gave me. I waited a whole week, but no answer came, not another word from her. And Mama and Papa\\'s return was drawing nearer and nearer. So I came to San Francisco to get her. I wrote her I was coming. I shouldn\\'t have done that, should I?Maybe not. It\\'s not always easy to know what to do. You haven\\'t found her?No, I haven\\'t. I wrote her that I would go to the St. Mark, and I begged her to come and let me talk to her even if she didn\\'t intend to go home with me. But she didn\\'t come. I waited three days, and she didn\\'t come, didn\\'t even send me a message of any sort.Spade nodded his blond satan\\'s head, frowned sympathetically, and tightened his lips together.It was horrible, Miss Wonderly said, trying to smile. I couldn\\'t sit there like that--waiting--not knowing what had happened to her, what might be happening to her. She stopped trying to smile. She shuddered. The only address I had was General Delivery. I wrote her another letter, and yesterday afternoon I went to the Post Office. I stayed there until after dark, but I didn\\'t see her. I went there again this morning, and still didn\\'t see Corinne, but I saw Floyd Thursby.Spade nodded again. His frown went away. In its place came a look of sharp attentiveness.He wouldn\\'t tell me where Corinne was, she went on, hope-lessly. He wouldn\\'t tell me anything, except that she was well and happy. But how can I believe that? That is what he would tell me anyhow, isn\\'t it?Sure, Spade agreed. But it might be true.I hope it is. I do hope it is, she exclaimed. But I can\\'t go back home like this, without having seen her, without even having talked to her on the phone. He wouldn\\'t take me to her. He said she didn\\'t want to see me. I can\\'t believe that. He promised to tell her he had seen me, and to bring her to see me--if she would come--this evening at the hotel. He said he knew she wouldn\\'t. He promised to come himself if she wouldn\\'t. He--She broke off with a startled hand to her mouth as the door opened.The man who had opened the door came in a step, said, Oh, excuse me! hastily took his brown hat from his head, and backed out.It\\'s all right, Miles, Spade told him. Come in. Miss Wonderly, this is Mr. Archer, my partner.Miles Archer came into the office again, shutting the door behind him, ducking his head and smiling at Miss Wonderly, making a vaguely polite gesture with the hat in his hand. He was of medium height, solidly built, wide in the shoulders, thick in the neck, with a jovial heavy-jawed red face and some grey in his close-trimmed hair. He was apparently as many years past forty as Spade was past thirty.Spade said: Miss Wonderly\\'s sister ran away from New York with a fellow named Floyd Thursby. They\\'re here. Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby and has a date with him tonight. Maybe he\\'ll bring the sister with him. The chances are he won\\'t. Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister and get her away from him and back home. He looked at Miss Wonderly. Right?Yes, she said indistinctly. The embarrassment that had gradually been driven away by Spade\\'s ingratiating smiles and nods and assurances was pinkening her face again. She looked at the bag in her lap and picked nervously at it with a gloved finger.Spade winked at his partner.Miles Archer came forward to stand at a corner of the desk. While the girl looked at her bag he looked at her. His little brown eyes ran their bold appraising gaze from her lowered face to her feet and up to her face again. Then he looked at Spade and made a silent whistling mouth of appreciation.Spade lifted two fingers from the arm of his chair in a brief warning gesture and said:We shouldn\\'t have any trouble with it. It\\'s simply a matter of having a man at the hotel this evening to shadow him away when he leaves, and shadow him until he leads us to your sister. If she comes with him, and you persuade her to return with you, so much the better. Otherwise--if she doesn\\'t want to leave him after we\\'ve found her--well, we\\'ll find a way of managing that.Archer said: Yeh. His voice was heavy, coarse.Miss Wonderly looked up at Spade, quickly, puckering her forehead between her eyebrows.Oh, but you must be careful! Her voice shook a little, and her lips shaped the words with nervous jerkiness. I\\'m deathly afraid of him, of what he might do. She\\'s so young and his bringing her here from New York is such a serious-- Mightn\\'t he--mightn\\'t he do--something to her?Spade smiled and patted the arms of his chair.Just leave that to us, he said. We\\'ll know how to handle him.But mightn\\'t he? she insisted.There\\'s always a chance. Spade nodded judicially. But you can trust us to take care of that.I do trust you, she said earnestly, \\t      --This text refers to an alternate \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\tAll the characters in this story are famously despicable. Private eye Sam Spade is motivated by personal gain and his own ego. His clients are no more moral--they are selfish, dishonest, double-crossing, greedy, and sometimes even violent. At the heart of this classic \"noir\" is the search for the valuable jewel-encrusted falcon. Despite the repugnance of the characters, William Dufris\\'s reading is tremendously likable. His enthusiasm is well suited to creating distinctive voices for each character and an overarching atmosphere of distrust. Dufris\\'s use of timing is impeccable--forcing slow, tortured silences that increase the suspense just when a print reader would be flying through the pages to discover the ending.  A.B.

He manages to keep his distance until he learns that Spencer\\'s parents have been murdered and it appears that Jordan and Spencer are next on the killer\\'s hit list. In an effort to keep them safe, and to help himself come to terms with the loss of his own family, Beau moves Jordan and Spencer to a remote beach house where his protective skills are put to the test.

View larger.Adjusting the Kreg Jig Jr. for different applications is quick and easy. View larger.Kreg Joinery: No Glue or Complicated Math RequiredThe Kreg Jig Jr. takes advantage of a technique called Kreg Joinery. Unlike other techniques, Kreg Joinery requires no glue, no complicated math, and no small army of clamps to make wood joints that will last.With Kreg Joinery, you can finish projects in hours instead of days. You won\\'t spend any time clamping, waiting for glue to dry, or wading through complicated math. It essentially involves drilling a hole at an angle into one workpiece, and connecting it to another workpiece with a self-tapping screw.Amazingly Strong with Half the EffortUnlike mortise and tenons, dowels, and biscuits, the self-tapping screws inside of every Kreg Joint hold the stock together without glue. You don\\'t have to worry about precisely lining up dowel holes, or spending hours cutting a perfect mortise and tenon--you simply drill the holes, drive the screws, and move on to the next project.And because what you see is what you get with Kreg Joinery, you won\\'t spend all your time calculating stock-overlaps and dry-fitting individual workpieces. All you need is simple math to get fast and accurate results.Kreg Jig Jr: The Perfect Home-Repair ToolThe Kreg Jig Jr. is an amazing repair jig with a compact design that lets you work where you need to most. Thanks to its Clamp Pad Adapter, the Jr. can be secured to the workpiece with any standard bar clamp or c-clamp. In addition, the adapter allows the jig to be attached directly to any Kreg Face Clamp (sold separately) for faster and more repeatable pocket-holes.From thin drawer boxes and craft projects to stout 2x4\\'s, this jig can handle them all. Independent Easy-Press positioning sliders feature nine separate depth settings, allowing you to easily join materials from 1/2-inch to 1-1/2-inches thick in 1/8-inch increments. And to set the jig properly, you simply depress the button on the side of the jig and move the sliders so your material thickness is aligned with the arrow on the jig body. It couldn\\'t be any easier.The Kreg Jig Jr. includes a compact, durable plastic carrying case that will ensure that you always have the tool, drill bit, and screws on hand to complete your next project. As a bonus, the case features a molded depth collar gauge for a handy reference.In addition to the Kreg Jig Jr. (model R3), Kreg offers DIYers and anyone new to Kreg joinery the Kreg Jig (model K4). For serious wood workers, Kreg offers the Kreg Jig Master System (model K3MS), the ultimate kit for Kreg Joinery.The Kreg DifferenceWhile each Kreg Jig has its own features designed to meet the particular needs of its users, all Kreg Jigs share a design and high-quality construction which add up to the \"Kreg Difference.\"Kit includes everything you need to get started.Each Kreg Jig features hardened steel drill guides that carry a 100-percent lifetime guarantee.

Mira, $6.50 (400p) ISBN 1-55166-919-6Coffey (Trust Me Once), which is a pseudonym for James and Nikoo McGoldrick, skillfully balances smalltown scandal and sexual intrigue with lively plotting and vivid characterizations in this engrossing romantic thriller. When 31-year-old social worker La Hardy learns that her brother has been convicted of murdering his estranged wife and two daughters, she returns to her conservative hometown of Stonybrook, Pa., to raise cash for the mounting legal bills and a death row appeal. La plans to fix up and sell the dilapidated childhood home where she was orphaned by the murder/suicide of her parents more than 20 years earlier, but she soon learns that old enmities die hard in her town. With the exception of her gorgeous next-door neighbor, Mick Conklin, who is conveniently a contractor, and his troubled teenage daughter, La is given the cold shoulder by unforgiving townsfolk and police who are convinced her family is cursed. Even after she's attacked in her home and threatened by a crazy Vietnam vet, the town sheriff blames her for disturbing the peace. For a thriller, there's very little action here. Instead, a series of tantalizing flashbacks help build suspense, and a thoroughly enchanting romantic subplot fleshes out the story.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\\tWhen her brother is sentenced to die for the murder of his estranged wife and two young daughters, Lea Hardy resolutely returns to Stonybrook, the town she fled years earlier after her parents' murder-suicide, to renovate and sell the family home in order to pay for a new lawyer. But the town has neither forgotten the old scandal nor forgiven the new, and someone in particular doesn't want the truth to come out and is willing to kill to prevent it. Well paced, suspenseful, and sometimes startling, Coffey's latest unexpectedly pairs a mystery filled with graphic violence and explicit sex with a sensitive love story. Add a couple of troubled teens, a dash of insanity, and a victim who was evil incarnate, and you get an intense, compelling story that will keep most readers guessing until the very end.

       " '1593355661': \"A former pilot who knows his way around the corridors of power on  Capitol Hill as well as the Pentagon, Patrick Davis spins a believable yarn  about the murder of an Air Force safety officer just before she was about to  blow the whistle on a fatal defect in a popular airplane. Originally built for the Air Force, the G-626 accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's passenger fleet, but Colonel Margaret Wildman's evidence would have grounded it and destroyed a billion-dollar merger between Boeing and Global, the flawed plane's manufacturer. Martin Collins, a retired Air Force investigator who consults on military homicides, doesn't want to believe his service was involved in the death of the colonel and her two young children, but everything points to Wildman's immediate superior, Marcus Holland, who may have been acting on orders from higher up in the chain of command. With a young special investigator who's got her own score to settle with Holland, and Simon Santos, an enigmatic detective whose wealth gives him entre to the highest levels of military and political influence, Martin finds himself in a world of deals and deal makers even Simon can't access. Davis's skillful pacing drives the narrative to a surprising and explosive denouement, but long before that his complex and well-developed protagonists engage the reader's interest and empathy. Simon's past holds a secret that's the clue to his determination to solve this cloudy and complicated case, and Martin is still grieving his dead wife and trying to find his way as a single parent. The Colonel is a strong, muscular thriller that confirms Davis's promise as a writer to watch. --Jane Adams\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tSet in a Washington, D.C., seething with politicos and  lobbyists, Davis's third political thriller (after The  Passenger) pits three unusual cops against a murderous  conspiracy. When a female air force colonel and her two children  are brutally tortured and murdered, a D.C. detective, an air  force investigator and a rural Virginia police chief find  themselves up to their handcuffs in suspects, motives,  high-level obstruction, coverups and more bodies. It turns out  that the colonel's death may be linked to a secret report she  was preparing to present to Congress that would disclose the  facts behind recent fatal airplane crashes, with implications  for the entire U.S. transportation system. A series of gripping  twists and turns and the revelation of a top-level conspiracy  will keep readers on edge, and Davis adds ballast with  well-drawn characters. Lt. Simon Santos, the D.C. detective, is  a wealthy bachelor who does not shake hands, has a dark family  past and takes some dubious investigative shortcuts. Capt.  Amanda Gardner, the air force investigator, is a hard-boiled pro  with a quick trigger who knows a bit too much about the leading  suspect. Rural cop and former government agent Martin Collins,  who narrates, is the steady influence who tries to keep the  three from getting killed, fired, arrested by the FBI or  crucified by the press. Refreshingly, Davis (an air force  veteran) does not use technology or electronic gimmicks to solve  the crime; instead, his protagonists rely on interrogation,  legwork and old-fashioned cop intuition. We can only hope for  more crime-busting drama from these gumshoes. Agent, Karen Solem  at Writers House. (July 9) Forecast: The government conspiracy coverup at the heart of this  story is a sure-fire element to attract readers. Davis's writing  has improved with each outing, and this third thriller will  undoubtedly establish his reputation.   Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tWhen an Air Force colonel is found murdered, along with her two young children, retired Air Force investigator Martin Collins is brought back into the fold to solve the crime. This third novel from the author of The General (1998) and The Passenger (1999) offers a plausible conspiracy thriller that keeps getting more and more complicated until all the threads are tied together, pretty much at the last possible moment. Collins is a sharp fellow, a former top-level crime investigator who's happy living the quiet life in rural Virginia but who can't resist the lure of a juicy case. And we can't pass this one up either: it's well put together, it isn't saturated with high-tech weaponry, and the plot, involving some fatal airplane crashes and some high-level Air Force officials, is fresh enough to hold our attention, despite the occasional moment when Davis falls back on standard gimmicks to build suspense. Best of all for a military thriller, the characters are made of something more lifelike than cardboard. Fans of Nelson DeMille will find this one entirely satisfying.

       " '0679765921': 'Flight Among the Tombs, Anthony Hecht\\'s sixth book of  poems published since 1954, shows one of America\\'s foremost poets working at  the top of his form. Part scholar, part circus ringmaster, Hecht calls our attention to three rings of his erudition: classical wit, Renaissance energy, and contemporary doubt. A fragment of Christopher Smart  provides the book\\'s title, but George Herbert, in whose clever prosodic  vineyards Hecht has long labored, casts the book\\'s longest shadow. The first half contains lyrical poems in which Death--both scythe-hauling figure and physical phenomenon--speaks as the central character inside a collage  of masks: carnival barker, film director, society lady, member of the  Harlem Guild of St. Luke, and, of course, poet. Hilarious and creepy, the  poems combine Hecht\\'s late-modernist sense of ironic humor with an orchestra  of Latin and Renaissance conceits, stripping away the latter\\'s theology to express a very inclusive mortality. Yet Hecht, whose deep humanity  prevents these poems from becoming mere set pieces of the macabre, turns this message of doom into a call to enjoy the unpredictable in life, as the speaker watching aristocrats dine says in Death the  Mexican Revolutionary,    We recommend the quail, Which you\\'d do well to eat Before your powers fail, For I inaugurate A brand-new social order Six cold, decisive feet South of the border.  Several occasional poems in the book\\'s second half mark the passing of Hecht\\'s generation, including For James Merrill: An Adieu  and A Death in Winter, honoring the memory of Joseph Brodsky. These poems are particularly moving in light of the rambunctious sensibility of the volume\\'s first half. At turns outrageous and somber, Flight Among  the Tombs is a surprising addition to Hecht\\'s oeuvre. --Edward Skoog\\tThis volume gathers all the poems published by Pulitzer Prize-winning Hecht since the appearance of The Transparent Man (LJ 6/15/90), but it is best understood as a supplement to the majestic progress of the Collected Earlier Poems (Knopf, 1990); it shares the earlier work\\'s preoccupation with matters of mortality and history, and, like that volume, this features a poetic sequence illustrated by Leonard Baskin\\'s unnerving wood engravings. That sequence, \"Presumptions of Death,\" is perhaps the last and strangest instantiation of the Danse Macabre, for in it Death not only draws us out of every condition and stage of life but meets us there, perfectly disguised as one of ourselves. A variety of lyrics, including elegies for fellow poets James Merrill and Joseph Brodsky, round out the volume. Hecht\\'s bitterly melodious lines perfectly express the rich ruminations of an outstanding poet; he is, like the camel of his poem, \"the royal pattern of patience,/ and wisdom\\'s legate.\" Highly recommended.?Graham Christian, Andover-Harvard Theological Lib., Cambridge, Mass.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tHecht is often ranked among such luminaries as W. H. Auden and James Merrill, an assessment based on his adroitness with form, classical frame of reference, and suppleness of thought and imagination. These traits are evident in this striking, two-part volume. The first section, \"Presumptions of Death,\" consists of a collaboration between Hecht and artist Leonard Baskin, whose wood engravings illustrate a remarkably ironic series of poems written from death\\'s point of view. Hecht\\'s grim reaper takes many shapes: an inquisitor, a whore, an archbishop, a painter, an Oxford don, a Mexican revolutionary, a film director, and a carnival barker. Whatever his guise, he is always amused, assuring us that \"I shall press to the core of every secret. / There is no match for my patience.\" These visions of death are at once wickedly clever and quite unsettling. The remainder of the book contains new poems on various subjects, but death haunts those pages, too, as Hecht bids adieu to soul mates James Merrill and Joseph Brodsky.  Donna Seaman\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tAnthony Hecht\\'s majestic development into a great poet has progressed across half-a-century. Flight Among the Tombs is his poignant and ironic masterpiece. With this book, he clearly becomes a fourth in the sequence of John Crowe Ransom, W.H.

And what, my dear,Does this remind you of? You are surprisedBy the familiar manner, the easy, sureIntimacy of my address. You wonderWhose curious voice is this? Why should that sceneSeem distantly familiar? Did something happenBack in my youth on a deserted pathLate on some unremembered afternoon?And now you\\'ll feel at times a fretful naggingAt the back of your mind as of something almost graspedBut tauntingly and cunningly evasive.It may go on for months, perhaps for years.Think of the memory game that children playedSo long ago. A grownup brought a trayLaden with objects hidden by a shawlOr coverlet with fine brocaded flowersBeneath which, like the roofs of a small city,Some secret things lay cloaked. Then at a signalThe cloth was whisked away for thirty seconds.You were allowed to do nothing but look,And then the cover was replaced. Remember?The tray contained bright densely crowded objects,Sometimes exotic--a small cloisonne egg,A candle-snuffer with an ivory handle--But simple things as well. It never occurredTo any of the children there to count them;You had been told simply to memorizeThe contents of the tray. Each child was givenPaper and pencil to list what he recalledAnd no one ever finally got them all;Something always escaped. Perhaps a needle,A gum eraser or a plastic ruler.And so it is that now, as you\\'re aboutTo eat or light a cigarette, somethingPasses too swiftly before you can take aim,Passes in furtive silence, in disguise,Glimpsed only hazily in retrospect--Like a clock\\'s strokes recounted once they\\'re done,Never with confidence. And now you\\'re angryAt what you think of as my long digressionWhen in fact it\\'s the eclipses of your mind,Those sink-holes, culverts, cisterns long avoidedAs dangerous, where the actual answer lies.As for my indirection, I\\'ll just sayI have more time than I know what to do with.Let me give you a hint. The voice you hearIs not the voice of someone you remember--Or rather, it\\'s that voice now greatly alteredBy certain events of which you\\'ve partly heard,Partly imagined, altogether feared.Does that help? No, I didn\\'t think it would.Perhaps we can return another time(A time when you\\'re conveniently abstracted)To the topic of my voice and of that smoke.IIMuch time elapses. (I could count the days;You, for your part, have no idea how many.)Today a color ad for undergarments,Some glossy pages of Victoria\\'s Secret,Modeled by a young blonde catches your eye.Nothing so vivid as a memoryResults. Perhaps a vague erotic sense,A fleeting impulse down between your legs,Stirs like a sleeping dog. Your mind beginsIts little, paltry Leporello\\'s listOf former girlfriends who pass in reviewAs images, stripped even of their names.And then you linger upon one. It\\'s me.Don\\'t be surprised. All that was long ago.Your indolent thought goes over my young breasts,Remembering, fondling, exciting you.How very long ago that was. It lastedAlmost two years. Two mainly happy years.In all that time, what did you learn of me?My name, my body, how best to go aboutMutual arousal, my taste in food and drinkAnd what would later be called substances.(These days among my friends I might be calledA woman of substance if I were still around.)You also learned, from a casual admission,That I had twice attempted suicide.Tact on both sides had left this unexplored.We both seemed to like sex for the same reason.It was, as they used to say, a little death,A tiny interval devoid of thoughtWhen even sensation is so localizedOnly one part of the body seems alive.And when you left I began the downhill slope.First one-night stands; then quickly I turned proIn order to get all the drugs I wanted.My looks went fast. I didn\\'t really care.The thing that I\\'d been after from the first,With you, with sex, with drugs, was oblivion.So it was easy. A simple overdoseKnocked back with half a bottle of good Scotch.In later years the rumors found you outThrough mutual friends. And somehow you rememberedThat I had been disowned by my family.My parents would have nothing to do with meAfter they found I\\'d been a prostitute,To say nothing of my trial suicides.So, as you guessed, when I at last succeeded,They acted as if I never had been born.(Let the day perish ... , as the scripture says.)There was no funeral, no cemetery,Nowhere for you to come in pilgrimage--Although from time to time you thought of me.Oh yes, my dear, you thought of me; I know.But less and less, of course, as time went on.And then you learned by a chance word of mouthThat I had been cremated, thereby findingMore of oblivion than I\\'d even hoped for.And now when I occur to you, the voiceYou hear is not the voice of what I wasWhen young and sexy and perhaps in love,But the weary voice shaped in your later mindBy a small sediment of fact and rumor,A faceless voice, a voice without a body.As for the winter scene of which I spoke--The smoke, my dear, the smoke. I am the smoke.',\n",

They are durable and used in many industrial applications. The black oxide coating provides some lubricity to the product, meaning that there is less friction generated when using these products. The coating also provides a mild corrosion resistance but should not be relied on in environments where corrosion resistance is a primary concern. Alloy steel is steel that has been alloyed with other materials to improve overall physical properties. Steels are designated by a four-number SAE Steel grade. The first two digits indicate the primary materials used to form the steel. The last two digits identify the percentage of carbon for the alloy (in hundredths). Tensile strength ranges for the alloys typically used in these fasteners range from 170,000 to 180,000 psi (pounds per square inch), making these amongst the strongest of materials. With a high cylindrical head, socket cap head fasteners offer high holding power at high torque levels. Hex socket drive systems are driven by hex wrenches or power tools with hexagonal bits.  A threaded fastener's size name includes information about the major external diameter, followed by the threads per inch, which indicates if it is coarse or fine.\",\n",

The Zambia cutting board is handcrafted using flattened strips of cured Bamboo bonded together with the highest rated, US laboratory tested and certified, formaldehyde-free adhesive specifically developed for food contact surfaces. Zambia's size, 13.5 x 7.25, makes it perfect for slicing and serving crusty french bread with fresh mozzarella. Zambia's unique look is created using the end grain or cross-section of the bamboo pole.  Small sections of the end grain are set in opposing directions creating the parquet design.  No stains or paint are used to create the two-tones of Zambia. The light tone is the Natural color of the Moso Bamboo and the scrumptious Honey shade is created in a very specialized heating process which caramelizes the natural sugar in the wood.  These colors are permanent and will not fade or wash out. Care: wash with warm water and mild detergent and occasionally wipe with mineral oil (Do not clean in the dishwasher). An Ecological wonder, Bamboo is a grass that grows to a harvestable height of 60 feet in 3 to 5 years.  It has an extensive root system that continually develops new shoots thus not requiring replanting making it an incredible self-renewing resource and a brilliant alternative to the wide spread clear cutting of our world's hard wood forests.

But they tell me he turns all sorts of colors if you fail to address him by that title.\" The speaker, a tweed-suited Southerner with a pouched face and an unruly shock of red hair shot with gray, blew a cloud from his snuff box and inhaled it, all of it. Not a grain floated to the polished wood floor of the austere office the two shared.\"Didn\\'t we have any privates in that war?\"\"Speak for yourself, Bluebelly,\" grinned the man in tweeds.The narrow, high-ceiling room smelled of tobacco and old dry leather, the former from a charred ebony-and-amber pipe clenched between the lean man\\'s teeth as far as the joint, the latter from the cracked and thumb-blurred bindings of fat law books squeezed pitilessly onto shelves covering the wall adjacent to the window. Paperwork had overflowed onto the seats of two roll top desks, leaving only the armchair, in which the pair took turns sitting. Beyond the arched window, ferries could be seen plying the broad brown flatness of the James River beneath motionless black mushrooms of smoke.\"Listen to this.\" An inveterate train rider, the man with the newspaper folded it expertly into a compact, easily read rectangle two inches wide. He was in his early forties, but already his wavy, dark brown hair was anchored in white side-whiskers to the angles of his jaw. His gold-rimmed reading glasses did nothing to soften the Lincolnesque planes of his features. \" \\'Asked what form McCall\\'s defense would take, General Crandall replied: \"It is not my client who is going on trial, but the U.S. Constitution itself, which guarantees the citizen\\'s right not to be tried more than once for the same offense. I shall leave the text of my oration up to the members of the First Continental Congress\".\\' Is he really planning to take that line?\"\"I doubt it,\" said the Southerner. \"But you can bet he\\'ll give it a whirl. The General\\'s not one to conserve ammunition. What does it say about us?\"The man handed him the newspaper. He unfolded it and read:* * *Heading the prosecution will be Julian Scout, that same Captain Scout who so successfully defended those members of the 12th New Hampshire charged with desertion in the face of the enemy at Cold Harbor during the late war. Neither he nor his assistant--one T. S. E. Bartholomew, a private practitioner and highly vocal Confederate sympathizer throughout the unpleasantness--could be reached for comment at press time, but other sources indicate a struggle in the offing, as sympathy for the defendant runs high locally.* * *\"Some hatchet job,\" observed Scout, grinding his teeth on the pipe stem. \"I\\'m a champion of cowards and you\\'re Johnny Reb. Just how vocal were you \\'throughout the unpleasantness,\\' Tessie?\"\"I ran for state representative in Minnesota against an abolitionist.\" Bartholomew flipped the newspaper into the fireplace. Although there was a November chill in the room, no flames burned in the grate; the chimney did not draw well.\"How far do you think Crandall will get with that double-jeopardy plea?\"\"That depends on Judge Blair. He\\'s had plenty of time to digest that stuff we gave him on Deadwood\\'s being an outlaw town. All Crandall\\'s got is the Constitution, and you and I both know how well that stands up in a modern court of law.\"For weeks, controversy had been raging in the press over the legality of a second trial for the accused murderer of James Butler Hickok. Jack McCall had been tried and acquitted by a miners\\' court in Dead-wood the day after the slaying. After fleeing to Laramie, Wyoming, to escape the wrath of Hickok\\'s friends, he had made the mistake of bragging of his deed while drinking in a saloon and was promptly arrested by a deputy U.S. marshal who had been among his audience. The prosecution maintained that the first trial had taken place in a region where constituted law did not prevail and was thus illegal.\"Crandall must know he doesn\\'t have a leg to stand on,\" suggested Scout\"Of course. But it\\'s in his client\\'s interest to delay as long as possible. Count on him dragging out every statute in the book. Then, when Blair\\'s reached the end of his tether, he\\'ll plead either self-defense or justifiable homicide, and hope he grabs at it\"\"I hope it\\'s self-defense. I\\'ve witnesses to prove McCall shot Hickok from behind without warning.\"\"To which Crandall will respond with as many to prove that it was a wise move. Never lose sight of the fact that the victim was a skilled assassin. We\\'ll be on firmer ground if he opts for justifiable, but even then everything will swing on Hickok\\'s character.\"Scout\\'s pipe had gone out. He struck a fresh match. \"This looked like such a simple case,\" he growled, between puffs. \"You\\'d think a corpse with a bullet hole in the back of its head was evidence enough to convict anyone, with or without eyewitnesses. And we\\'re loaded with them.\"Bartholomew laughed shortly. \"Now you\\'re talking like an eastern lawyer. It\\'s not so simple out here where legends are made.\"\"I wish you\\'d reconsider and plead this one. You\\'re twice the orator I am.\"\"In a Yankee court? With my drawl? I\\'d do more damage than good. Don\\'t sell yourself short, Julian. This case can make you.\"I\\'m not so sure I want to be made. I like the view from where I\\'m sitting.\"\"You can see a lot farther from the judge\\'s bench.\" Bartholomew was looking at him. He had small, bright eyes that sometimes took on a wicked glitter, as now.Scout made no reply. He got the tobacco going and shook out the match. \"What about the conspiracy angle?\"In his first trial, McCall had blamed Hickok\\'s killing of his brother for his decision to slay the famed gunman. Although subsequent investigation failed to uphold this claim, the revenge angle (and, some asserted, two hundred ounces of gold dust smuggled into the jury room) had led to the defendant\\'s release. But McCall\\'s aborted attempt to escape from the Yankton jail earlier that month had seriously damaged his case the second time around, and he had elected to turn state\\'s evidence by identifying one John Varnes as the man who had paid him to kill Hickok.Bartholomew shook his head abruptly, frowning, The expression heightened his resemblance to a bull-dog. \"You\\'d just be muddying the waters. Varnes has disappeared without a trace and McCall has changed his mind again. It\\'s the prosecution\\'s job to simplify, not complicate. Leave that to the defense. There\\'ll be time enough to bring up the thirty pieces of silver when McCall repeats that story about Hickok killing his brother with a hoe.\"\"Do you think he\\'ll testify?\"\"Probably not. Under cross-examination he\\'d fold like a pair of deuces on a fifty-dollar bet. But in case I\\'m wrong you can hit him with his own statement about the blood money.\"Scout sucked on his pipe in silence as though considering his partner\\'s advice. In reality he\\'d already thought about it, just as he\\'d anticipated almost everything else the older man had said. Eleven years before, Scout had come out of the war a green young lawyer with a raw brilliance for courtroom tactics that had manifested itself, unpopularly, in the court-martial of five soldiers of the 12th New Hampshire regiment accused of cowardice during the fighting at Cold Harbor, Virginia, in 1864. He had won their acquittal on a technicality at the expense of his reputation, as the five had already been convicted in the pages of every major northern newspaper, and after leaving the service he had found every law-firm door closed to him in four eastern states. Penniless, he was contemplating sneaking out of his Pittsburgh hotel to beat the bill when a telegram came offering him employment with the firm of Bartholomew  Hobbs, Yankton, D. T. The wire had been following him from city to city for six weeks, and included a bank draft large enough to settle his debts and make the journey west with some left over.Immediately he had become the protg of Bartholomew, a former Minnesota public defender with a flair for politics, who began by instructing him to forget everything he had learned about due process. His next step was to enroll Scout in a dramatics course, where he was taught the techniques of oratory and, in Bartholomew\\'s own words, \"the ancient and honorable art of lying.\" After that the senior attorney had educated him personally in courtroom histrionics, demonstrating the ways in which a juror\\'s emotions could be played upon so that whatever points the opposition brought up, no matter how solid, were rendered meaningless--a practice referred to as \"stirring up dust.\"Scout\\'s first client after \"graduation\" was an illiterate ranch hand accused of hamstringing a neighbor\\'s prize racing stallion. His fee was guaranteed by the man\\'s employer. In the face of daunting evidence, through innuendo and delaying tactics which dragged the trial over four exhausting weeks, the young lawyer managed to obtain a hung jury. A second trial was planned, but nagging doubts raised by the amount of insurance the horse\\'s owner had taken out on his property shortly before the mutilation incident unnerved the plaintiff and the charges were dismissed.There were other cases, some of which Scout lost, but these were far outweighed by his victories. Two years ago he had been offered the appointment as federal prosecutor and, on Bartholomew\\'s advice, had accepted it. Shortly thereafter his mentor sold out his partnership and joined Scout\\'s unofficial staff where he was paid from the prosecutor\\'s own pocket. A confirmed bachelor of simple tastes, he was more than able to afford his former teacher\\'s salary, a token amount since \"Tessie\" lived quite comfortably off his investments.Of late, however, their instructor-pupil relatio...\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMass Market Paperback\\t edition.',\n",

What once used to be a show about self-worth and society\\'s perception of beauty as portrayed by plastic-surgery patients has become about the abject humiliation of women and rampant storylines. It alienated many fans, who found its love of excess ludicrous and at times, unforgivable. Maybe it was the storyline about Matt (John Hensley), who discovers the love of his life was actually a transsexual, shaves his head and starts dating a white supremacist (American Dreams\\' Brittany Snow). Or the disturbing new plastic-surgery cases (obese woman physically stuck to her couch, a 17-year-old petrified fetus). Or even the new surgeon Quentin Costa (Bruno Campos) who sleeps with male patients, romances Julia (Joely Richardson) and turns out to have a little \"physical quirk\" of his own? But the knife that truly stabbed the show\\'s pace into the ground was the ongoing mystery of the Carver, a rapist/killer in a creepy porcelain mask who disfigures victims. Just when the show starts to jell, another character with their mouth cut Black Dahlia-style turns up and throws the show back into a whodunnit, and not even a well-crafted one at that: By the time they reveal the killer\\'s identity, you just don\\'t care anymore.  Someone also made a mess of the characters, or at least turned them all manic-depressive; the moral flip-flopping between Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) is inexplicable at best. One goes wild, the other grows a conscience--and then they switch sides. One is on the brink of divorce, the other gets engaged--and another switch.

Taking time off and serving through City Year was the best decision of my life.\" Matt\\'s description of teaching fourth-graders in a rooftop garden in Boston, Massachusetts, sparked an interest in Adam that was more relevant and focused than his vision of spending at least four more years sitting in classrooms.While Adam spoke convincingly about how taking time off might be the right option for him, we recalled a time not too long ago when some in our generation had acted on President Kennedy\\'s assertion that \"one person can make a difference and every person should try\" through the Peace Corps or Volunteers In Service to America (VISTA). And many more of us--at least those not called by military service--had heard the words but continued unquestioningly and dutifully down the road prescribed by our schools, our parents, and our society. We also recalled conversations with a few peers who chose to set forth in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s on gap-year opportunities before or during college. They--like Adam\\'s City Year schoolmate--considered the experience powerful, pivotal, and life changing.As Adam wondered about the options that might be open to him if he took time off, Karl recalled how, more than twenty years earlier, as a principal of Heathwood Hall in South Carolina, several of his students had questioned whether they were ready for college ... yet. At that time, he had a fortuitous encounter with Cornelius \"Neil\" Bull, an educator and visionary, who made the case that there were alternatives to going straight to college for students who were prepared to choose them.Inspired by Adam\\'s interest, we made a quick search of the Internet. We found that Neil Bull\\'s vision had grown into theCenter for Interim Programs, LLC, located in Princeton, New Jersey, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Interim is a locus for helping thousands of students design and implement customized gap-year strategies. Soon Adam was on a conference call with Holly Bull, Neil\\'s daughter and the Center\\'s interim president. She described the myriad opportunities open to him if he was interested in pursuing intrepid pathways.As we grew accustomed to the prospect of Adam\\'s stepping off the beaten track to college, we were reassured by the examples of other families who had been the beneficiaries of the Interim experience. Holly (like her father before her) ensured our involvement every step along the way, delving into our view of Adam\\'s options--and particularly reinforcing his college goals as an integral part of an overall plan. By the time of our initial phone interview with Holly, we believed Adam was prepared, along with us, to consider the prospects of taking time off as part of his educational and (perhaps) life goals.\"Would you like to work with a group in Central America? Explore where The Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed in New Zealand? Volunteer as a forest ranger in the Redwoods? Teach environmental studies in Appalachia? Intern with the British parliament?\" Adam\\'s eyes grew wide as Holly was able to connect with exactly what Adam was hoping for: These were his options! He did have choices!What emerged from these conference calls--and the conversations we had with Adam around them--was a plan for an \"extra-curriculum\" sequence of events that, combined, would last a year or more. Adam\\'s gap experiences would begin with a weeklong outdoor education program in New Jersey at Tom Brown, Jr.\\'s Tracker School and then would take him overseas to teach in Costa Rica and to work on an environmental preserve in New Zealand, finally leading him to a job in Texas as aninstructor in environmental education. Holly\\'s sense of Adam\\'s goals provided a rationale for each program he considered and its respective place in the overall plan.The first stage in Adam\\'s international journey was ten weeks living with a host family in a small mountain village in Costa Rica and teaching English with another volunteer in the local elementary school through a program called Global Routes. The growth, maturity, and perspective that he gained were evident to us in numerous ways, but can be illustrated through e-mails written at that time. He discovered through working with kids who were incredibly excited about learning that teaching was his calling. His fluency in Spanish grew exponentially as he became immersed in the life of the village.He also gained a perspective on the value of resources. \"In my school there is absolutely nothing,\" he wrote in one e-mail. He proposed to develop a fund for textbooks and scholarships. \"Tons of the kids here want to go to school but can\\'t go past sixth grade because of the lack of funds,\" he relayed. \"Their hunger for learning and teaching in Costa Rica is awesome and has totally changed my view on education.\" During his time in Central America, he managed to raise more than two thousand dollars for books and scholarships, mostly through contacts at his former high school.Last Thanksgiving, he sent this e-mail to his family: \"It\\'s amazing that this part of my life is about to end. It seems like a few days ago that I arrived in San Jos, and now I\\'m five days away from leaving. This experience has been the best thing that ever happened to me, and I appreciate all the support you all gave me throughout. My village will be forever thankful to you guys, and you can know that you really have made friends in Costa Rica.\"The e-mails and the stories he has shared since provide only a hint of the breadth and depth of Adam\\'s experiences and the strength of the bonds he developed with his host family, his students, and his peers in the Global Routes program.Adam\\'s experiences were eye-opening to us, as parents, and we continue to be amazed and inspired by Adam\\'s growth, development, and contributions during and after his time-off experiences. As Adam learned, so did we.With a combined forty years of experience in public policy, we have been able to contribute to debates and initiatives regarding what can be done to improve educational outcomes for students. As teachers and parents, we\\'ve had the opportunity to help guide students in their options regarding post-high school choices. But, as effective educators will confide, the right personal stories can be extremely instructive. And we\\'ve rarely encountered stories as powerful as those of students who\\'ve taken time off before or during college. They have been able to learn more about themselves, and, at an age when many still call them kids, they have given back to the world in ways many adults could not even imagine.This book is based on the stories of the dozens of students we\\'ve met and interviewed who\\'ve chosen to follow their own intrepid paths. It also is based on the experiences of dozens more families, counselors, program leaders, teachers, and other educators who have supported them along the way. The examples and practical advice in these pages are offered in the hope that many other young Americans and their families will step off the traditional road and benefit from the gap-year advantage--and come to believe, as we do, that we can all gain a better perspective on our place in the world and the wisdom that will help us in our journey through it.We look forward to hearing more stories and learning of your journeys in the months and years ahead.Karl Haigler and Rae Nelson Advance, North Carolina 20051Reality CheckYou have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was.--ABRAHAM LINCOLNTHE STAKES ARE HIGH for the almost fifteen million high school students who will return to classrooms this fall, most with the goal of attending a college or university immediately after graduation.

Exploring the vagaries and vicissitudes of middle-class family life, Marotta writes breezily readable prose.

Surely readers will identify with children who mangle Christmas songs into lines like \"Round John Virgin\" and convert the Lord\\'s Prayer into \"Harold be thy name.\" Occasionally, Marotta reveals a bit more edge to her wit, declaring that the Latinate phrase \"Ibid.\" means \"boy am I sick of writing this paper,\" and likening the issue of young children\\'s grasp of sex to the old Watergate question: \"What Do They Know and When Did They Know It.\" This is mostly enjoyable fluff.

Born in Boston, raised in Lowell 20 miles to the north, she graduated from Smith College, then taught high school in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, where she says she was permanently changed by contact with the frank and intelligent questions of the adolescents she met there. After having some babies and putting in thousands of hours laundering and folding teensy jumpsuits, it came to her that what she\\'d REALLY always wanted to do was write a newspaper column. This idea came to her when the babies were napping, as she leafed through her high school yearbook and saw what her sweet, brooch-wearing English teacher had once penned there. \"I hope you do write that column,\" the lady had said; so Terry sat down and wrote one then and there and has been doing the same thing every week ever since, come fire or funeral or the onset of labor. Back in NASA\\'s glory days, she got clear to the finals in the competition designed to send a journalist up in the Shuttle, and though that initiative sleeps yet in bureaucratic mothballs, she still considers herself to be in training for the job. Besides producing the column and writing books, Marotta has also done pieces for Chicken Soup for the Mother\\'s Soul, Woman\\'s Day, and Parents.

       " '0786889144': '\"You know you\\'ve lived a hell of a life when stardom is anticlimactic,\" declares Butler, star of Grace Under Fire, in this candid, bittersweet memoir, which she began writing years before she became famous. Aphoristic, melancholy and ultimately triumphant, it sometimes reads like a great country song. Her father, eccentric and imperious, abandoned the family when Brett was four; only after he died did adult Brett discover they shared a maverick sensibility. Books, comedy and a supportive bohemian (if depressive) mother helped Brett weather a gothic Southern childhood. As a teenager, though, she escaped with drink, drugs and sex; at 20 she married a man who began beating her the day after their wedding. Three years later, she ditched her husband in Georgia and discovered stand-up comedy in Houston, finally channeling her creativity and tendency to excess. Moving to New York City, she advanced her comedy career as she discovered sobriety, a lasting love and a grounded sense of herself. Since this memoir concerns only Butler\\'s pre-Hollywood life, fans may be disappointed that she doesn\\'t discuss her show, dish Tinseltown or confess to her recent plastic surgery. But her book is rich enough without that. Photos not seen by PW. $500,000 ad/promo; first serial to People; author tour.

And while Butler was understandably outraged, it\\'s easy to see what that astonished analyst meant. This tell-all-and-then-tell-some- more memoir stands out in its genre both for its frankness and for the awfulness of Butler\\'s early life. Her father, an alcoholic, disappeared early. Butler grew up fast, living with her mother and four sisters in a succession of southern towns. She sampled drugs and started using alcohol as an adolescent, tried college and gave up, then slipped into an abusive marriage. She\\'s unsparing in describing the duplicities of the alcoholic, but curiously, she\\'s less persuasive in talking about how comedy helped her tap into something essential and restorative, or in probing the sources of her creativity. By contrast with what\\'s come before, her descriptions of her growing success (the book ends before the launching of her series) seem flat and rushed, cluttered with names. Still, a better-than-average entry in the genre, best for its vividly rendered early scenes.

The quilt has been given away because few knew the importance of the quilt.  Within the quilted pattern lies the key to a treasure.  Gray\\'s family fortune is in dire straights and he needs to find the treasure.  A letter to his father had the riddle, \"If you have the measure to search for my treasure, it will line your pockets with gold.  Decipher Mary\\'s Fortune and let your pleasure unfold.\"  He finds out that his cousin has given the quilt to Lincoln Marshall in return for work and he sets off to find this poor labourer. Instead of finding Lincoln, however he comes across Baines who he later discovers is Lincoln\\'s niece.  Despite Baines\\' common upbringing Gray finds himself attracted to this beautiful woman.  Baines works as a seamstress and in a tavern to support herself.  She has the quilt but is loath to tell the distinguished stranger because she is afraid that Lincoln has stolen the quilt and she will be causing her Uncle to be arrested.  Despite this, Baines also has an instant attraction to Gray and finds herself torn. When she finally decides to tell Gray she has the quilt it is stolen from her small shack, and she and Gray must either bond together to find it or separate amidst doubt and guilt. Patterns of Love is a strong, plot driven story.  I found that the plot kept me going when the characters didn\\'t.  Both Gray and Baines were stereotypical romance novel characters.  The story was still entertaining, I just knew not to expect much from them.  I found Gray\\'s cousin and his wife to be more interesting characters.

(Nick Thran Quill & Quire)`After nearly thirty years, Sherman's work stands up well. Merrick's goulish condition is treated with deadpan understatement; the poet takes us into the cruel world of Victorian freak shows, while conveying the dignified intelligence of the Elephant man with sensitivity and restraint. Sherman's free verse is spare, conversational, expresses Merrick's passion and despair with bluntness and poignancy. Along the way, he does the poet's work by linking up the Elephant Mans story with larger themes.' (Brian Campbell The Rover)Kenneth Shermans collection of poems Words For Elephant Man was first published in 1983 and has just been rereleased by Porcupines Quill. It reads with the richness typical of a painting or a novel  so moving at times that I found myself weeping. It is hard to keep in mind that one is not hearing the actual voice of the so-called Elephant Man Joseph Merrick, so strongly felt is the authenticity of the outsider who longs to be welcomed in, which Sherman renders with restrained, elegant strokes. I felt I had taken an emotional and visual journey  something Ive come to expect from reading a novel, but not always from a collection of poems. (Laura Albert Jewish Daily Forward)While the story of the Elephant Man may be familiar to many, Shermans poems take readers to the heart of understanding the intelligent, tender-hearted man who lived within his bales of skin. Containing etchings by George Raab, Words for Elephant Man moves beyond the reach of poetry readers, making it an essential book for anyone interested in Merricks life and times. (Jennifer Fandel ForeWord Reviews)\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\t`Sherman always seems to be listening to the voice of Canadian soil and landscape at the same time as he is attentive to the great European metaphysical theme of the soul in conflict with the world and time.' (Fraser Sutherland The Globe and Mail)\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\tWords for Elephant Man came to me in a rush. The first draft was written in three weeks. I spent another month polishing the poems and fretting over structure, and the book was largely done. The story of John Merrick, a man born into poverty and afflicted with a dreadful disease, afforded my poetic imagination a considerable range. Victorian England served as mirror for our own times. The historical subject matter allowed the interspersion of lyrical poetry and nineteenth-century medical reports, legal documents and testimonies -- a weave that gives the work a documentary sensibility.Yet at its heart Words for Elephant Man is not social commentary but spiritual testimony. I was going through a personal crisis and the figure of John Merrick served as a mask for my own experience. Writing the book was a release.How should the story be told? The first version employed a chronological approach. When I showed the book to Dennis Lee he made the intelligent suggestion that I begin the book in medias res, and then use flashback to present Merrick's early years. Eli Mandel helped shape the ending of the book and suggested concluding with the pathology report on Merrick's skeleton. My friend, the versatile printmaker George Raab, created prints reminiscent of the nineteenth century, lending the book a haunting authenticity. (Kenneth Sherman)\\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.\\tKenneth Sherman was born in Toronto in 1950. He has a BA from York University, where he studied with Eli Mandel and Irving Layton, and an MA in English Literature from the University of Toronto. While a student at York, Sherman co-founded and edited the literary journal Waves. From 1974--1975 he travelled extensively through Asia. He is a full-time faculty member at Sheridan College where he teaches Communications; he also teaches a course in creative writing at the University of Toronto. In 1982, Sherman was writer-in-residence at Trent University. In 1986 he was invited by the Chinese government to lecture on contemporary Canadian literature at universities and government institutions in Beijing. In 1988, he received a Canada Council grant to travel through Poland and Russia. This experience inspired several of the essays in his book Void and Voice (1998).

       " 'B0071HPOLK': \"For a sex comedy, Bart Freundlich's fourth feature Trust the Man takes many of its cues from 1980s-era Woody Allen, but is neither as sexy nor as funny as intended. It's the tale of two couples. Rebecca (Julianne Moore, Freundlich's real-life wife) is an actress. Her husband, Tom (David Duchovny, Moore's Evolution co-star), is a stay-at-home dad, much like Patrick Wilson's character in the considerably darker Little Children. The Manhattan dwellers have two kids. Fellow New Yorker Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal), an aspiring author, lives with Rebecca's brother, Tobey (Billy Crudup, sporting an ill-advised goatee), a sports writer. They've been together for seven years. Elaine is ready for marriage and a baby; Toby, not so much. Both men have roving eyes, Tom for single mother Pamela (Dagmara Dominczyk) and Tobey for ex-girlfriend Faith (Eva Mendes), a newlywed. Rebecca and Elaine, in their sincerity, may be more sympathetic, but all they ever seem to talk about is their unsatisfactory sex lives. Naturally, something has to give and it does--for all four. On the downside, Trust the Man finds Freundlich in a bit of a holding pattern. In retrospect, domestic drama The Myth of Fingerprints, Freundlich's first film, is still the writer/director's best. Though James LeGros and Duchovny pal Garry Shandling provide amusing cameos, the main reason to catch Trust the Man is for Duchovny himself in his most fully realized role since the inimitable Agent Fox Mulder--oddly likable despite his many faults. --Kathleen C.

While Rebecca's slacker brother, Tobey (Billy Crudup), can't seem to commit to his aspiring-novelist girlfriend, Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal).

Still, songs from each region speak to the wonderful diversity of Italian traditions.  Mellow acoustic cuts prevail:  Full-throated vocals star in presentations from Fratelli Mancuso and Novalia, but the Argicantus cut is a folky ditty devoid of its usual defiant techno production. Sugary accordions are emphasized over banging drums. The stereotypical notions of operatic tenors singing to senoras in the town square should be demolished by this manifestation of the depth and diversity of Italian musical traditions.

George Riehle, a seemingly inoffensive liquor store clerk in Queens, is the sociopathic predator the media has dubbed The Chocolate Man. Using candy bars as bait, he has in less than two years kidnapped, sexually molested, and murdered seven adolescent boys. Two days before Christmas, the compulsive George feels the need to strike again. In the heat of the moment, however, he makes a consequential error, abducting a precocious nine-year-old girl named Emily Lookinland who had wandered away from her mother Lauren in Rego Park. Disoriented by the unexpected break in an established pattern, the wanted man does not quite know what to do with himself or his frightened but levelheaded captive. But as the NYPD task force created to apprehend The Chocolate Man swings into action and Laurie (a single mom) copes with a frenzied, intrusive press corps, George (an obsessive counter who talks to himself) and Emily form a relationship of sorts. Among other things, she learns that he has never wanted to hurt children, only mothers (because his all but ignored him). Acting on tips from observant or suspicious neighbors, the cops close in on George, but it is a distraught Laurie who forces the issue, locating him on her own. Events come to a violent conclusion during a high-speed chase down the Long Island Expressway on a snowy Christmas morning when Emily and her beloved mother must rely on one another for the gift of life.

       " '0465016340': 'Why do some nations and ethnic groups prosper while others stagnate? Harrison, a former director of the U.S. Agency for International Development in Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, finds the answer in a culture\\'s values. In his diagnosis, Brazil\\'s hard-working, family-oriented European and Japanese immigrants spurred that nation\\'s dynamic growth, whereas Mexico\\'s economic disaster and failure to build solid democratic institutions are due to its \"Hispanic value system\" promoting passivity, mistrust of outsiders and an overemphasis on family. The U.S. black underclass\\'s plight, he maintains, is due not primarily to racism but rather to \"a set of values and attitudes, strongly influenced by the slavery experience\" and perpetuated by the ghetto. Featuring success stories such as Japan, Spain, Korea and Taiwan, this study verges on blaming the victim and slights political factors as well as the West\\'s domination and molding of Third World markets and regimes to serve its own needs. Harrison ends with a jeremiad blaming U.S. decline on the erosion of education and the work ethic, TV, a quick-fix mentality and welfare programs. First serial to the National Interest. Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tComing at a time of national and international concern about the persistence of poverty, Who Prospers? focuses on the part that individuals\\' basic values play in advancing prosperity. For Harrison, both national and ethnic advancement are tied to cultures that value work, frugality, planning for the future, ties to the community as a whole, and education--the traditional ethic lauded by Max Weber in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1930). Expanding the ethic to include the Confucianism of Asia and the post-Franco energy of Spain, Harrison, a former director of development programs in Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development, reviews the postwar economic \"miracles\" of Brazil, Spain, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. He then examines the experience of Asians, Mexicans, and African Americans in the United States and each group\\'s success or failure at integration into the American economic mainstream. In all cases, Harrison finds the presence or absence of the basic values he has identified to be the decisive factor in development. Harrison concludes with thoughtful recommendations for reform that are refreshing in their lack of dogmatism and their optimism. Recommended for most libraries.- Mary Jane Ballou, Ford Fdn. Lib., New YorkCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tHarrison, a sometime director of development programs for the US Agency for International Development, argues that the extent to which countries are economically and politically ``successful\\'\\' is principally determined by cultural factors. Why are some countries prosperous and democratic while others poor and politically oppressed? According to Harrison, the main reason is a country\\'s values and attitudes. He finds that four factors are especially important: the ``radius of trust,\\'\\' or degree to which the members of a society identify with one another; the ``rigor\\'\\' of the ethical system; the way authority is exercised; and attitudes about work, innovation, saving, and profit. Harrison\\'s thesis is advertised by his publishers as ``myth-shattering,\\'\\' but his conclusion surely comes as no surprise--that the most successful cultures, according to his criteria, have been those most influenced by the Protestant work ethic and Western values of democracy and individual rights. This view does become controversial, although no less predictable, in the chapters that analyze in cultural terms the relative performance of Asian-, Mexican-, and Afro-Americans, and in the closing essay about the danger of overall decline in the US. The argument that the recent success of countries like Japan, Taiwan, and Korea can be traced to their Confucian traditions is less familiar and more interesting in the light of the common Western assumption that progress depends on individualism. On the whole, Harrison has no trouble showing the general importance of culture as a factor of national success, and he provides many pertinent examples. But his stronger claim that culture is the principal determinant of success is never substantiated. His method is to pile up evidence favoring his view while doing little to confront or even record possible counterarguments.

It features high-quality Canon optics with a 16x optical zoom, image stabilization, a 1.33 megapixel CCD, and advanced photo capabilities. The Optura 20 improves on its counterpart, the Optura 20, with Super Night Shooting mode, a larger 3.5-inch LCD, and higher capacity battery.  Lens and Optics The powerful 16x optical zoom lets you capture your subject with razor-sharp detail even from a distance, while the 320x digital zoom takes you even closer, revealing details too small to see with the naked eye. When capturing digital still images, the lens provides a 15x optical zoom--the equivalent of a 41-620 mm lens on a 35mm photo camera. The Optura 20 also features a 1.33-megapixel CCD and an image stabilization system that compensates for camcorder shake, even while panning and zooming.  Canon's DIGIC DV system makes it possible to achieve accurate color for both video and digital photos. Since video and photos have different color requirements, DIGIC DV utilizes two different color techniques to maximize video quality on a TV and still image quality for print or computer display.  Digital Stills With its 1.33-megapixel resolution, you can capture digital stills up to 1280 by 960 pixels (for 4 x 6-inch prints). Additionally, the Optura 20's Simultaneous Photo Record featureenables you to record high-quality video to a MiniDV tape and e-mail-ready digital photos (640 x 480 pixels) to a memory card at the same time. You can also capture a rapid succession of photos just like the motor drive on a camera. With a single press of a button, the Opture 20 records 30 VGA (640 x 480) frames at a rate of 3 frames per second or 20 SXGA (1280 x 960) frames at 2 frames per second.  Images are stored on the included 8 MB Secure Digital memory card; the camcorder is also compatible with MultiMedia (MMC) cards.  More Features The Optura 20 also offers a Super Night mode and Low Light Plus mode, allowing for continued recording even in virtual darkness. An assist lamp in the front of the camera illuminates the subject just enough to allow excellent image quality while retaining the desired mood or effect. The Optura 20 is also bundled with a higher capacity battery, the BP-512, for longer continuous shooting.  Other features include:  The Advanced Accessory Shoe allows you to add optional lights, flashes, and microphones. Manual controls include focus, AE shift, shutter speeds, and white balance. Direct print feature with optional Canon Card Photo Printers CP-200 and CP-20 and select Canon Bubble Jet Printers.   Inputs and Outputs The Optura 20 standard DV IEEE1394 port (also referred to as Firewire), which provides a lossless connection to a PC or other DV machines.

Though Alfred Werker is credited as director, noir and Western vet Anthony Mann actually helmed the majority of the film; his muscular direction lends palpable suspense to the picture, aided in no small part by longtime collaborators John C.

       " 'B00005IATJ': \"A certain breathless immediacy pulses through Carol Reed's Night Train to Munich, even if the movie conveys a puckish sense of fun. The immediacy probably stems from the topical subject matter: released in Britain in the summer of 1940, less than a year after the beginning of  World War II, the film serves up still-fresh images of espionage, Hitler's SS, and concentration camps. The opening reels are packed with excitement: plucky Czech Margaret Lockwood hustles her scientist father (James Harcourt) out from under the Nazi thumb, only to fall to more skullduggery after emigrating to England. Rex Harrison plays her breezy British contact, first seen singing a jaunty tune as a song plugger (for anyone familiar with Harrison's later My Fair Lady vocalizing, his career here is highly amusing). The second half of the picture concentrates on a journey across Europe as the war is breaking out, and clearly aspires to (and frequently matches) the comic-suspenseful mode perfected in Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, which also starred Lockwood. Both films were written by the crack team of Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder, who bring in that glorious cricket-loving combo from The Lady Vanishes, Charters and Caldicott. They are played again by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne, who are just as funny here as they were in the earlier picture. Years before The Third Man and The Fallen Idol, Reed's direction navigates the tricky shifts between comedy, high adventure, and can-do wartime patriotism: see the splendid silent beat that follows the moment Charters and Caldicott hear that war has begun, broken by Charters's serious reflection that it will now be dashed difficult to get his golf clubs out of Europe. Superb. The Criterion release of Night Train to Munich includes a half-hour conversation between experts on the filmmakers--staged, fittingly, aboard an old train car. --Robert Horton\",\n",

It allows teachers to make program, curriculum, and instructional decisions based on research results. The authors\\' goal is to guide readers to think as research consumers through directed learning activities based on current integrated language arts principles and practices.  Chapter topics include the research process; research designs; reading and evaluating research reports; reading and evaluating sections: abstract, background, and purpose; reading and interpreting reviews of research; and locating information about research reports.  For teachers of any and all grade levelspre-kindergarten through post-graduate.\\tWe intend the third edition of Interpreting Educational Research: An Introduction for Consumers of Research to be used in introductory research courses in which elementary and early childhood education teachers, reading/literacy specialists, special education teachers, and content area teachers at the middle and secondary school levels are prepared as consumers rather than as producers of educational research. We provide preservice and in-service teachers with basic knowledge and skills for reading, interpreting, and evaluating both quantitative and qualitative educational research, so that they can make program, curriculum, and instructional decisions based upon those research results. This knowledge base is useful for teachers who collaborate in research projects with college and university faculty and other teachers. In addition, we provide a guide for composing teacher-as-researcher action research projects and syntheses of research.    Through directed learning activities based on current integrated language arts principles and practices for reading and writing content area discourse, we guide readers to independence in the use of techniques for reading, interpreting, evaluating, and writing about education research. The evaluation of education research is approached by us so teachers will become research consumers by understanding the underlying methodological and procedural assumptions used by educators who are research producers. In essence, teachers are guided in research literacy learning to think as research producers.   NATURE OF THE REVISION   Our revisions consist of updating information about how research is produced, providing more recent examples of research methodology, replacing the complete research reports in Appendix B and adding an additional study, and providing current standards for producing action or program evaluation research. The discussions throughout the text are supported with examples of what we feel are good, curriculum-based, quantitative and qualitative research reports representing the fields of elementary-, middle-, and secondary-school general and content-area education, reading/literacy education, and gifted and special education. A very important revision we have made is to update and expand the explanation and interpretation of qualitative research. We have added information about the use of effect size in analyzing quantitative results. The discussion about interpreting and evaluating reviews of research has been revised to reflect current thought about syntheses of research. Information and strategies for locating research reports through the use of electronic databases and the Internet have been updated and expanded. Because we feel that all educators, whether consumers or producers of research, should know and appreciate the criteria for conducting instructional program evaluations, we have added the program evaluation standards that have been established by professional associations.   ORGANIZATION   In this revision, we have maintained the organization and chapter topics of the previous editions. The text is organized into eleven chapters and three appendices. In Chapters 1, 2, and 3, we lead the reader to an understanding of research designs, the general procedures of research producers, and a plan for reading research reports. In Chapters 4 through 9, we present extended discussions of the aspects of research design and methodology and illustrations of the manner in which research producers present them in research reports. In Chapters 10 and 11, we provide information about reading and writing reviews of research and about sources for locating research reports. In the appendices are a glossary of key terms, six complete research reports for additional study and analysis, and ethical standards for conducting educational and program evaluation research.    We begin each chapter with a graphic overview of the content (as shown on page ix) and focus questions so readers can attend to the key ideas of the chapter and the interrelationships portrayed in the structured overview. In the main body of the chapters, we provide techniques for reading, interpreting, and writing about specific sections of research reports. In the activities section at the end of each chapter, we present ways for the reader to gain greater understanding of the key concepts and proficiency in applying the evaluative techniques. For each of these activities, we provide the reader with feedback in which we give samples of how we might respond to our own students\\' work.   SPECIAL FEATURES   Special features of the text are as follows:    The text is intended for teachers with a range of backgrounds: generalists, content-area teachers, reading/literacy specialists, special educators, and middle- and secondary-school teachers. The examples used throughout the text are drawn from current curriculum-based research literature that these teachers will find relevant to their specific instructional situations. All research designs are illustrated with published research. The material is conceptualized for consumers of educational research. The text is intended to teach preservice and in-service teachers, in a non-threatening supportive manner, to read and write about educational research. A step-by-step process leads teachers to understand and use research reports. Information is included-about strategies for reading both quantitative and qualitative (ethnographic or naturalistic) research. The chapters begin with a structured overview of the content showing each chapter\\'s focus in relation to the overall content of the text. Specific strategies that have been shown to be effective for the reading of typical content-area texts and the writing of content-area-related expository prose are applied to the reading of research reports and the writing of research evaluations. Ample practice is provided for developing readers\\' skills in evaluating educational research. The text provides readers with an understanding of syntheses of research and research meta-analyses and gives guidance in the preparation of action syntheses of research. A glossary contains the definitions of all key terms presented in the text. Within the text, key terms are highlighted the first time they are introduced. The appendices contain complete research reports for additional practice in evaluating research or for use in class assignments. The text is intended to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills to act as teacher-researchers and to create classroom-based action research projects and syntheses of research.

Bachardy, whose work hangs in such museums as the Metropolitan in New York and London\\'s National Portrait Gallery, has assembled portraits of 33 noted personalities in the artsAincluding Maggie Smith, Laurence Olivier, Linda Ronstadt, Ellsworth Kelly, James Merrill, Iris Murdoch, Ruby KeelerAalong with his diary entries about the sittings, which occurred between 1973 and 1984. As striking as his drawings are, his perceptive and informative journal entries are what make this collection so vital. Candid, often witty and decidedly opinionated, he spares no details about how difficult some of his subjects have been (\"I will have approval of what you do today, won\\'t I?\" inquires a diffident Alice Faye). Speaking frequently of his own life (he was novelist Christopher Isherwood\\'s lover for 33 years, beginning when Bachardy was 18 and the writer was 48), Bachardy provides a unique view of his creative process. He is at his most revealing, however, when he describes the complex interplay between subject and artist. (Nov.)

Through literary icon Isherwood (his companion of over 30 years), the artist gained entrance to a world that mesmerized him at an early age. This culmination of his work is a fascinating blend of art and anecdote. Bachardy\\'s own interpretations, however, tend to undermine his purported intention to portray truthfulness of vision (his vision) regardless of his subjects\\' preconceptions. Thus, the reader is treated to a highly subjective (though entertaining) view despite the pretense of objectivity.

(Shortly after its release, the movie gained a new notoriety when Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, who appears near the end of the film, resigned his post amid a male prostitute\\'s allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct.) For most of the film, we follow a charismatic teacher, Becky Fischer, as she trains young soldiers in \"God\\'s Army\" at a camp in North Dakota. Some of the kids emerge as likable and bright, and eager to continue their work as pint-sized preachers; elsewhere, the visions of children speaking in tongues and falling to the floor in ecstasy are more troubling. Even more arresting is the vision of a generation of children home-schooled to believe that the Bible is science, or Fischer\\'s certainty that America\\'s flawed system of democracy will someday be replaced by a theocracy. (In one scene, a cardboard cut-out of George W. Bush is presented to the children, who react by laying their hands on the figure as though in a religious procession.) Filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady maintain neutrality about all this, maybe too much so (they throw in some interviews with radio host Mike Papantonio to provide a liberal-Christian viewpoint) and one would like to know more about the grown-ups presented here. Power broker Haggard is the creepiest person in the film, an insincere smooth talker whose advice to one of the young would-be campgoers comes across as entirely cynical. Time will tell whether the film\\'s Christian soldiers will be marching onward. --Robert Horton\\tControversial documentary about kids attending a theological summer camp.

Tuyen, a lesbian artist, is the daughter of Vietnamese immigrants who still grieve for the son they lost in Vietnam. Carla, a biracial woman, grapples with a misplaced sense of responsibility for her younger brother, Jamal, whose rap sheet is more than Carla can fix. Oku struggles under the watchful, and often resentful, eye of his father, a Jamaican immigrant who feels both threatened and frustrated by his son's poetic aspiration. Jackie, a young black woman whose family came to Toronto from Halifax, vicariously mourns the loss of her parents' youthful dreams. Although the friends have an unspoken rule never to talk of family, the problems of home spill inevitably into their daily lives, culminating in an explosive moment when the families finally meet.

Brand moved to Canada when she was 17 to attend the University of Toronto, where she earned a degree in Philosophy and English, a Masters in the Philosophy of Education and pursued PhD studies in Womens History but left the program to make time for creative writing. Dionne Brand first came to prominence in Canada as a poet.  Her books of poetry include No Language Is Neutral, a finalist for the Governor Generals Award, and Land to Light On, winner of the Governor Generals Award and the Trillium Award and thirsty, finalist for the Griffin Prize and winner of the Pat Lowther Award for poetry. Brand is also the author of the acclaimed novels In Another Place, Not Here, which was shortlisted for the Chapters/Books in Canada First Novel Award and the Trillium Award, and At the Full and Change of the Moon. Her works of non-fiction include Bread Out of Stone and A Map to the Door of No Return.    What We All Long For was published to great critical acclaim in 2005. While writing the novel, Brand would find herself gazing out the window of a restaurant in the very Toronto neighbourhood occupied by her characters. Id be looking through the window and Id think this is like the frame of the book, the frame of reality: There they are: a young Asian woman passing by with a young black woman passing by, with a young Italian man passing by, she says in an interview with The Toronto Star. A recent Vanity Fair article quotes her as saying Ive read New York and London and Paris. And I thought this city needs to be written like that, too.In addition to her literary accomplishments, Brand is Professor of English in the School of English and Theatre Studies at the University of Guelph.\\tONEThis city hovers above the forty-third parallel; thats illusory of course. Winters on the other hand, theres nothing vague about them. Winters here are inevitable, sometimes unforgiving. Two years ago, they had to bring the army in to dig the city out from under the snow. The streets were glacial, the electrical wires were brittle, the telephones were useless. The whole city stood still; the trees more than usual. The cars and driveways were obliterated. Politicians were falling over each other to explain what had happened and who was to blame  who had privatized the snow plows and why the city wasnt prepared. The truth is you cant prepare for something like that. Its fate. Nature will do that sort of thing  dump thousands of tons of snow on the city just to say, Dont make too many plans or assumptions, dont get ahead of yourself. Spring this year couldnt come too soon  and it didnt. It took its time  melting at its own pace, over running ice-blocked sewer drains, swelling the Humber River and the Don River stretching to the lake. The sound of the city was of trickling water.Have you ever smelled this city at the beginning of spring? Dead winter circling still, it smells of eagerness and embarrassment and, most of all, longing. Garbage, buried under snowbanks for months, gradually reappears like old habits  plastic bags, pop cans  the alleyways are cluttered in a mess of bottles and old shoes and thrown-away beds. People look as if theyre unravelling. Theyre on their last nerves. Theyre suddenly eager for human touch. People will walk up to perfect strangers and tell them anything. After the grey days and the heavy skies of whats passed, an unfamiliar face will smile and make a remark as if there had been a conversation going on all along. The fate of everyone is open again. New lives can be started, or at least spring is the occasion to make it seem possible. No matter how dreary yesterday was, all the complications and problems that bore down then, now seem carried away by the melting streets. At least the clearing skies and the new breath of air from the lake, both, seduce people into thinking that.Its 8 A.M. on a Wednesday of this early spring, and the subway train rumbles across the bridge over the Humber River. People are packed in tightly, and they all look dazed, as if recovering from a blow. Theres the smell of perfume and sweat, and wet hair and mint, coffee and burned toast. There is a tension, holding in all the sounds that bodies make in the morning. Mostly people are quiet, unless theyre young, like the three who just got on  no annoying boss to be endured all day. They grab hold of the upper hand-bars and as the train moves off they crash into one another, giggling. Their laughter rattles around in the car, then they grow mockingly self-conscious and quiet, noticing the uptightness on the train, but they cant stay serious and explode again into laughter.One of them has a camera, shes Asian, shes wearing an old oilskin coat, and you want to look at her, shes beautiful in a strange way. Not the pouting corporate beauty on the ad for shampoo above her head, she has the beauty a falcon has: watchful, feathered, clawed, and probing. Another ones a young black man; hes carrying a drum in a duffel bag. Hes trying to find space for it on the floor, and hes getting annoyed looks all around. Theres an enviable loose physical allure to him. He has a few days growth on his face, and when he smiles his eyebrows, his eyes  his whole face cant help its seduction. The third is another woman, she might be Italian, southern. Shes bony like a mantis in her yellow slick plastic coat, except her mouth has a voluptuousness to it, and her eyes, the long eyelashes weigh them down. The Asian woman points the camera at her, coaxes her for a smile, and the flash goes off and she looks startled. Its obvious theyve been out all night. Theyre talking now about some friend of theirs whom the young man loves. But all three are finally subdued by the taut silence around them, as if succumbing to some law theyd broken. Who wants to hear about love so early in the morning?Mornings are like that on the subway trains  everyone having left their sovereign houses and apartments and rooms to enter the crossroads of the city, they first try at not letting the city touch them, holding on to the meagre privacy of a city with three million people. But eventually theyre disrupted like this. Anonymity is the big lie of a city. You arent anonymous at all. Youre common, really, common like so many pebbles, so many specks of dirt, so many atoms of materiality.Now that conversation has entered everyones heads, and will follow them to work; theyll be trying to figure out the rest of the story all day. Now theyll be wondering where those three were last night, and someone will think, Why isnt my life like that? Free like a young persons. Someone will go off into a flight of imagination as to where theyd been  probably the railroad tracks, probably High Park, probably smoking dope at a party, drinking beer and dancing. Definitely dancing. And some other jealous rider will think, That bunch of free loaders! Never worked a day in their lives! Life will get them hard some time, dont you worry.And jammed in a seat down the car theres a man who hardly understands English at all, but he hears the tinkle of laughter, and it surprises him out of his own declensions on fatehow he ended up here and whats to be his next move, and how the small panic that he feels disgusts him. He rouses himself from going over the details of his life, repeating them in his head as if to the woman reading a newspaper next to him. The laughter pierces him, and he thinks that hes never heard laughter sound so pure, and it is his first week in this city. Only when he was very, very little  a boy  then he heard it, he remembers.What floats in the air on a subway train like this is chance. People stand or sit with the thin magnetic film of their life wrapped around them. They think theyre safe, but they know theyre not. Any minute you can crash into someone elses life, and if youre lucky, its good, its like walking on light.There are Italian neighbourhoods and Vietnamese neighbourhoods in this city; there are Chinese ones and Ukrainian ones and Pakistani ones and Korean ones and African ones. Name a region on the planet and theres someone from there, here. All of them sit on Ojibway land, but hardly any of them know it or care because that genealogy is wilfully untraceable except in the name of the city itself. Theyd only have to look, though, but it could be that what they know hurts them already, and what if they found out something even more damaging? These are people who are used to the earth beneath them shifting, and they all want it to stop  and if that means they must pretend to know nothing, well, thats the sacrifice they make.But as at any crossroad there are permutations of existence. People turn into other people imperceptibly, unconsciously, right here in the grumbling train. And on the sidewalks, after theyve emerged from the stations, after being sandpapered by the jostling and scraping that a city like this does, all the lives theyve hoarded, all the ghosts theyve carried, all the inversions theyve made for protection, all the scars and marks and records for recognition  the whole heterogeneous baggage falls out with each step on the pavement. Theres so much spillage.In this city there are Bulgarian mechanics, there are Eritrean accountants, Colombian caf owners, Latvian book publishers, Welsh roofers, Afghani dancers, Iranian mathematicians, Tamil cooks in Thai restaurants, Calabrese boys with Jamaican accents, Fushen deejays, Filipina-Saudi beauticians; Russian doctors changing tires, there are Romanian bill collectors, Cape Croker fishmongers, Japanese grocery clerks, French gas meter readers, German bakers, Haitian and Bengali taxi drivers with Irish dispatchers.Lives in the city are doubled, tripled, conjugated  women and men all trying to handle their own chain of events, trying to keep the story straight in their own heads. At times they catch themselves in sensational lies, embellishing or avoiding a nasty secret here and there, juggling the lines of causality, and before you know it, its impossible to tell one thread from another. In this city, like everywhere, people work, they eat, they drink, they have sex, but its hard not to wake up here without the certainty of misapprehension.From the Hardcover edition.\",\n",

       " 'B000059HEF': 'Celebrating Emerson, Lake & Palmer\\'s 1992-93 \"Black Moon\" comeback tour,  this 79-minute documentary is a jumbled hash of footage from throughout the  band\\'s two-decade career. But despite its haphazard assembly, it\\'s a guaranteed  treasure for ELP loyalists. Any attempt to visually document ELP\\'s history would  pose a challenge, since their visual record is relatively sparse compared to  many of the major rock acts of the 1970s. So it\\'s a blessing that this  documentary digs thoroughly into the archives, and every important phase of  ELP\\'s evolution is included, however briefly. One might argue with the strategy  to forgo chronological progression and weave disparate footage into a convoluted  tapestry, but it\\'s the music that counts, and on that point the film delivers  the goods.  In addition to grainy footage from the earliest days of ELP\\'s prog-rock  ascension (including what little footage exists of their breakthrough debut at  the 1970 Isle of Wight rock festival), the documentary integrates several ELP  interviews with crucial performances of the band\\'s best-known compositions. The  highlight, by far, is footage from ELP\\'s record-breaking performance in  Montreal\\'s Olympic Stadium in 1977, during their brief (and prohibitively  expensive) tour with a 67-piece orchestra. The performance of \"Pirates\" alone  makes this a must-have disc, even though it\\'s interrupted by older footage and  interview clips. A video of \"Black Moon\" and 1992 Royal Albert Hall concert  footage round out the program. It\\'s a mixed blessing, to be sure, but given the  lack of choice, Welcome Back is a welcome and altogether essential  document for ELP fans everywhere. --Jeff Shannon\\tWelcome Back is a musical biography outlining the birth and rebirth of a supergroup. In the first ten years of their existence, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, and Carl Palmer produced 6 Platinum and 5 Gold albums. In 1991, the three musicians came together to work on a new album and this video follows the creative and sometimes difficult reunion of one of rock\\'s foremost progressive bands. \"Welcome Back\" features live performances from their sellout 1992/93 Black Moon Tour, proving that after a ten year break, none of the magic has been lost. Including vintage footage, interviews with the band and over 70 minutes of classic ELP, this is a collector\\'s piece for all true fans.

His novel The Good Old Boys was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.\\t1Death, when it finally came, would be savage and swift. But the waiting seemed eternal. For more than two hours Lieutenant David Buckalew had huddled with his nineteen tired and ragged men in this vulnerable hilltop redoubt and had wondered when the Indians would come shrieking up that barren slope to take them.What in the hell were they waiting for?A chilly wind swept across the low circle of hastily piled rocks. Buckalew fastened the three remaining buttons of his gray coat, the only remnant of a uniform that had been new and proud a few months ago in Texas. The wind searched its way through a long rent beneath his right arm. He held the arm against his body and shivered. He wondered if April was really that cold or if the chill came from within.This, he thought bitterly, was an unfitting place for twenty men from Texas to die, and an unfitting way. They had come to an unfamiliar land to fight a just and honorable war against the Union Army, not to be cut to ribbons by a band of Indians with whom they had no quarrel, whose tribe they didn\\'t even know.The hard-used Texans had come upon the warriors while working their way along the fringe of scrub pine timber, moving southward through the mountains of eastern New Mexico. The confrontation had surprised the Indians as much as the Texans. The Indians had brought their horses to a sudden halt and gazed uncertainly at the white men across the space of perhaps a hundred yards. There had been at least thirty of them, and probably nearer forty. The number had been growing since. Buckalew had seen additional warriors trailing in.Perhaps that indicated a respect of sorts. He hadn\\'t seen much respect lately. Since he had been assigned to this unit against his will and theirs, he had encountered difficulty in getting the men to obey his orders, or even listen to him. But when they faced the Indians e had merely pointed toward the top of this hill. He had had to put spurs to his big brown horse to keep from being left behind. There had been stragglers earlier along the trail, but there were none on this hurried climb. The Indians had followed along, shouting challenges but firing no shots.At the top of the hill the men had quickly, and without directions, set about building what fortification they could. They stacked rocks into a rough circular wall as a shield.That the Indians could sweep up that hillside and wipe them out, David Buckalew had no doubt. But it wouldn\\'t be done cheaply or easily.The men had tried to dig down behind the crude wall but made to headway in the stony ground, for they had no real tools for the job. For the twentieth time he expanded his spyglass to full length with cold-sweaty hands and took a long sweeping look downhill. For some time he had watched Indians working in and out of a narrow pass. Now he saw little movement.If they\\'d caught us in there, we\\'d be dead already, he thought, shivering. Weighing heavily upon him was the hard realization that he had almost led the men into that pass. He hadn\\'t given Indians a thought at the time--he had seen no seed to--and he had been reasonably sure no Yankee pursuit had passed them to set up an ambush. But solid old Sergeant Noley Mitchell had saved him from that fatal mistake. He had suggested they climb up over the rough side of the hill. David had seen no need for it, but the men started to follow Mitchell\\'s suggestion anyway. There had been nothing left for the lieutenant to do but make it an order and salvage whatever dignity be might from a situation already out of his hands.It had been clear from the start that although David Buckalew had the commission, Noley Mitchell had the men.Mitchell had evidenced no malice that David could see as he watched the men climbing the hill. He said simply, \"Call it a notion, Davey.\"That was the way it had been since he had been assigned to this unit in Albuquerque: Davey. Not Lieutenant, not Sir, but just Davey to Noley Mitchell, as if David were some kid, not a man already in his twenties. It was little wonder the rest of the men didn\\'t respect his rank.Mitchell had said as they started bringing up the rear, \"I just don\\'t like gettin\\' caught in tight, narrow places. Goes back to ridin\\' a rough horse through a narrow gate when I was a boy and crushin\\' my leg against the post. I never forgot it, though it was a long time ago.\" It had indeed been a long time, because Noley Mitchell was twice David\\'s age, and perhaps a bit more. In deference to that age, David gave him the benefit of many nagging doubts.Now that Mitchell had been proven right about their not going through the pass, David knew the men were thinking and perhaps even saying among themselves that it was the old sergeant--not the young lieutenant--who had saved them from dying in it. Of course it had been only a temporary reprieve, for it looked very likely that they would die on the hilltop instead.He could clearly see both ends of the pass. When the Indians came against them it would probably be from the south end. He kept bringing the spyglass to his eye and searching in that direction. Eventually he caught a flutter of movement of the north. He blinked and looked again. Because of the distance, the image jumped and danced. He knelt to brace the telescope against a boulder and very slowly swung the end around until he could focus on what he had seen.\"Yankees!\" he said aloud and in surprise. \"A bunch of them, ridin\\' straight into the pass.\"He knew suddenly why the Indians hadn\\'t yet bothered the little Texas group huddled behind their miserable pile of rocks. They had easier prey to trap, and more of them.Sergeant Mitchell, kneeling down carefully on stiff knees, could see little with his naked eyes. David judged that he probably needed spectacles. \"Let me have the glass a minute, Davey.\"David grunted. Rank meant no more to Mitchell--or to the rest of these men--than it meant to a packmule. Mentally they were civilians, and they would never be anything else. So, for that matter, was David. But at least he tried to be a soldier. Lately he felt he was the only one left who did.Mitchell growled about his difficulty he bringing the glass to bear on the target. He rubbed a ham-sized fist over his eye and tried again. \"Yep, it\\'s bluebellies.\"David said, \"They\\'ve taken the pressure off of us for now. Might be a good time for us to clear out.\"Mitchell ran stubby fingers through a gray-salted two-inch tangle of beard coarse as porcupine quills and shook his head. \"They\\'d just come after us later, if they\\'re of a mind to. Where they caught us might not be half as good as the place we\\'ve got right here, button.\"Mitchell had a Texan\\'s way of referring to any young person as button, no matter how much military rank he might carry. Texans stood in awe of few things, and certainly not the gold bars of a second lieutenant. David understood that Mitchell had served many years as sheriff in some county south of Austin. Nothing fazed him much.The men had heard Mitchell\\'s comment. If David ordered them to go, mot would probably stay here anyway. He saved himself the humiliation.The chilly wind kept finding its way through the split seams of the gray coat his mother had made for him. The piping, stitched with great hopes by loving hands, hung loose and useless. The left sleeve showed a dark stain, and a hole that had been carelessly darned by male hands unused to needle and thread. David let his mind run back to a time when it was new, to that grand marshaling day in San Antonio, a fine day of fiery speeches and patriotism. With the stirring words still echoing in their minds, an intrepid band of Texas Confederates had started westward on a march meant to carry them all the way to the Pacific.This was the Territory of New Mexico in April of 1862. The Civil War had pitted white man against white man, and red men against them all. It had been less than a year since flamboyant Captain John R. Baylor, famed for his exploits as a Texas Ranger, had recruited his Second Texas Mounted Rifles in San Antonio and had led them across the desert to begin the conquest of the Western territories for the greater glory of the Confederacy. It had seemed a splendid idea at the time, and to David it still did. The Union forts in New Mexico and Arizona were poorly defended. A preponderance of their officers and a fair percentage of their enlisted men had been Southerners who had resigned at the outset of the war. They had returned to their homes to help raise an army for the Confederacy, leaving their former posts short on men and shorter on leadership. Moreover, because these forts were so far from the East and adjoined on one side by Confederate Texas, they were virtually isolated. They were considered beyond help if any concerted effort were made against them.Behind Baylor\\'s fast-moving cavalry had moved the huge but slower brigade or Henry Hopkins Sibley, late of the Union Army post in Santa Fe, now a general for Jefferson Davis. He knew the western military installations by virtue of his service there; he knew the weak points of every one. The Texans had first taken Fort Bliss at Paso del Norte without bloodshed. Poorly equipped from the standpoint of arms, and mostly dressed in civilian clothes because nobody had the time or the material to supply proper uniforms, the Texas force had overcome distance and heat and cold and hunger through eight hard months on alien ground. They had marched from one victory to another, plucking Union apples from the treeFort Fillmore, San Augustine Springs, Valverde. They had raised the Texas flag over Albuquerque and ancient Santa Fe.Total victory had seemed in easy reach, for the Arizona side of the Territory presented no challenge. Tucson was in Confederate hands. Beyond Arizona lay California, ripe for the taking. Its goldfields would finance the Confederacy\\'s armed might. Its great open seacoast would provide an outlet to the world, and outlet so huge no Union blockade could seal it.With all that in Confederate hands, how long could t...',\n",

       " '1400034892': 'In this highly entertaining and accomplished first novel by a well-known English journalist and music critic, two men who became friends as children in London during WWII are reunited after 40 years. In 1939, nine-year-old Martin Simmonds meets Dovidl Rapoport, a violin prodigy the same age. Martin\\'s father is a music impresario, and when Dovidl is sent by his Polish parents to study in England, he offers the boy lodging in his own home. Dovidl and Martin quickly become best friends. Dovidl\\'s parents perish in the Holocaust; then, in 1951, Dovidl-his name changed to the more palatable Eli-is about to embark on a career as a concert virtuoso when he disappears on the day of his debut. Martin becomes obsessed with his friend\\'s disappearance, and after decades of searching finally finds him in a dreary town in the north of England. Lebrecht\\'s deep knowledge of music, his insights and his verbal inventiveness enliven the book (describing two awkward professors, he says they \"stand out like frayed cuffs on a funeral suit\"). However, the novel drags in the middle with the backstory of the two boys living through the blitz; this is material that has been presented elsewhere and in greater depth. Also, there\\'s no real mystery in unraveling either the location or identity of Rapoport. Simmonds\\'s supposedly epic quest (\"I am consumed by thoughts of finding him\") is over in less than two days, and it\\'s a letdown for the reader not to be able to sift through tantalizing clues. These shortcomings aside, this is a confidently written and engaging first novel by a talented writer. Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\\t*Starred Review* Winner of the 2002 Whitbread Prize for a first novel, Lebrecht, cultural commentator for the BBC, brings to life an intriguing tale about music and betrayal. Dovidl Rappoport is a violin prodigy and a Polish refugee whose family perished in the Holocaust. He now lives with a wealthy Jewish family in London and befriends their socially awkward son, Martin Simmonds. Martin\\'s father, a musical impresario, trains Dovidl for the biggest debut on the London stage, and Martin is commandeered to act as caretaker. The two become close friends, forming a sybaritic relationship. Dovidl, however, slowly begins to slink into London\\'s seamier nightlife and eventually disappears on the day of his much-anticipated debut, wreaking havoc on the family and its business. Forty years later, Martin discovers a trace of the vanished prodigy and eventually ekes out a plan to avenge the betrayal all those years ago. Lebrecht\\'s story delves into the horrors of the Holocaust and the Blitz, as well as the quiet communities of Hasidic Judaism that developed in Britain after the flight of so many refugees. What emerges is a vivid and outstanding story that sings about artistry, genius, music, love, envy, friendship, and revenge. Michael SpinellaCopyright  American Library Association.

For a time the two boys are closer than brothers. But on the day he is to make his official debut, Dovidl disappears. Only 40 years later does Martin get his first clue about what happened to him.  In this ravishing novel of music and suspense, Norman Lebrecht unravels the strands of love, envy and exploitation that knot geniuses to their admirers.

There is no romance,  no mortal struggle, in digitised so-called work. It is a virtual  pursuit, without real vice or virtue. Mine, on the other hand, is a  people profession, hence almost obsolescent.It would not do to enquire too closely into the purpose of my trip. \\'Is  your journey really necessary?\\' nagged the railway hoardings during the  war. No, not enough to convince the auditors, who will slash my  expenses claim on seeing the negligible returns. Nor to satisfy Myrtle,  who will raise a quizzical eyebrow and register a connubial debt. There  is no pot of gold at the end of my trail nor, truth be told, enough  profit to interest a Sunday boot-saler--which is not, of course, what I  tell the accountants (\\'must keep in touch with consumer trends\\'), or  Myrtle (\\'meeting a familiar face can make all the difference when  money\\'s tight\\'). What matters is that I know why I am going, and I  don\\'t have to make excuses to myself. Escape, or the illusion of it, is  what keeps me alive and my business more or less solvent.Survival instinct propels me through the Euston crowds towards a  reserved first-class seat on the nine-oh-three Intercity Express, my  chest pounding with unaccustomed effort and an absurd anticipation of  adventure. Absurd, because previous expeditions have attested beyond  reasonable doubt that any prospect of adventure will get scotched at  source by my innate reserve and speckless propriety--attributes that  are bound to be mentioned in my none-too-distant obsequies, alongside  the Dear Departed\\'s musical expertise, mordant wit and discreet  philanthropy.Adventure is, in any case, antithetical to my nature and inadvisable in  my state of health. Furred arteries and a fear of bypass surgery have  imposed severe restraints. I am limited to six lengths of the  health-club pool and half a mile on the electronic treadmill;  excitement is strenuously avoided; conjugality is conducted rarely and  with the circumspection of porcupines. \\'Take care of yourself,\\' are  Myrtle\\'s parting words and, for her sake, I do try. In the absence of  marital ardour, it\\'s the least I can do.Yet, even a rackety, unbypassed old heart can be stirred by departure  fantasy. As I board the train, my pulse picks up ten points in fake  anticipation. I look ahead breathlessly, with a reassuring sense of  dj vu. It\\'s like watching televised football highlights on a Saturday  night when you\\'ve already heard the classified results on the radio.  The programme may reveal some fine points of form and skill, but any  tension has been ruled out by an incontrovertible foreknowledge of the  outcome.Watching stale soccer from the snug of a prized deco armchair is the  limit of my permitted thrills--a sad comedown for one who was groomed  to make things happen. Sad to have slipped from motivator to spectator,  from the wings of great stages to a piece of high-winged furniture.  Still, there are compensations. By staying out of the thick of things,  I have acquired an aura of what, in small-business circles, passes for  timeless wisdom.Lifelong prudence has reaped its rewards. My town house has a heated  indoor pool, I holiday winter and summer in wickedly overpriced Swiss  resorts and my pension arrangements are structured to keep me in  comfort for three lifetimes. \\'Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people,\\' said  the prophet Isaiah--so we made it the tribal aspiration. What greater  calm can a man find on earth than the quiet rustling of gilt-edged  assets?At Rotary and Bnai Brith you cannot tell me apart from the rest of the  Lodge, and that is how I like it; none of the other brothers has, to my  certain knowledge, been invaded by genius and ruined by its defection.  Forget I mentioned that: not many people are meant to know about it.  \\'Mustn\\'t grumble,\\' my father used to say, when asked how he was; and so  do I. Normality is my nirvana. Only within, deep within, at the clotted  edge of irreparable loss, do I feel the need for an unnecessary journey  that will allow me to avoid devastating self-contemplation and the  acceleration of inherited arteriosclerosis.I wouldn\\'t be surprised if the railways were mostly run for people like  me, half-wrecked psyches in perpetual flight from the missing part. I  can just see a Development Director springing his brainwave initiative  at a board meeting. \\'Why don\\'t we run extra Monday-morning services to  the boondocks?\\' he proposes brightly. \\'There must be thousands of  useless deadweights, dog-ends and waiting-for-godders who are just  dying to get away.\\'Settling in my window seat I pop two pills, a brand-name sedative and a  homoeopathic palliative, shutting my eyes for ten minutes of yogic  meditation. My Harley Street consultant (the cardiologist, not the  naturopath) advises daily exercise and the avoidance of agitation.  Being of a responsible disposition, I eat warily and carry a  kidney-donor card. If I see a pretty girl or a police chase, I look  away. In Michelin-starred restaurants, I order steamed fish. I have  many friends but no recent lovers, vague interests but no driving  passions.Myrtle, my partner in life, has a life largely of her own. A  large-boned lady of healthy appetites, she lunches sparingly in good  causes and plays bridge for her metropolitan borough. She took it up in  her thirties, after having children, discerning in the pastime an  outlet for her formidable memory and jugular instincts. Myrtle can  remember the seating plan at every chicken-schnitzel wedding we have  attended, the Order of Service at Her Majesty\\'s Coronation, the  universal symbols of the periodic table and the entire line-up of the  Hungarian football team that inflicted England\\'s first home defeat,  3-6, in the aforementioned Coronation Year, which was also the year of  our marriage. Many\\'s the time I have urged her to apply her remarkable  mental powers to a worthier object than a pack of cards. But Myrtle\\'s  tolerance for ladies who lunch on behalf of the starving and homeless  is limited.Our two sons have grown up and apart from us, triumphs of private  schooling and canny marriages. One is a Kensington obstetrician with a  trophy wife, the other a libel lawyer with a traditional spouse. Over  dinner, I prefer the barrister\\'s scurrilous gossip to the manicured  sanctimony of a society abortionist. But I feel no satisfying patrimony  when, on Friday nights, we play a charade of happy families around a  table groaning with murderously poly-saturated fats. Monastically  picking at my wife\\'s heedlessly prepared dietary dynamite, I retire  dyspeptically to bed with a glass of camomile tea and the Spectator,a  lifelong habit, while coffee is taken in the lounge. My apologies are  accepted with a wince of scepticism. Some in the family, I suspect,  ascribe my medical condition to chronic hypochondria.A decent Omm-trance is pretty much unattainable on a train that starts  and lurches through a thicket of signals, then spurts past outer  suburbs like a runaway horse. Once the speed settles to a steady  rocking, incomprehensible announcements splutter forth about the  whereabouts of the refreshment car and would the chief steward please  make his way to first class, thank you.Giving up the quest for inner peace and undistracted by the silvered  February landscape, my attention turns to business, which barely needs  it. The company I keep going is a spectre of the firm that my father  founded in 1919 \\'to advance the appreciation of music among men and  women of modest means\\'. In its heyday, Simmonds was a household name,  to be found in the nation\\'s living rooms among the Wedgwood teacups,  Hornby toys and grafted aspidistras in Robertson\\'s jampots. Simmonds  (Symphonic Scores and Concerts) Ltd manufactured piano reductions of  orchestral masterpieces, issued in noble purple covers for the uniform  price of sixpence. We also produced popular lives of the great  composers, albumised folk-songs and approachable novelties by  uncelebrated living composers. But the heart of Simmonds was the  concert division, which organised orchestral nights for all the family,  grannies to toddlers, at group discounts that worked out at less than  the price of a cinema seat.Simmonds\\' suite of offices, nuzzling the old Queen\\'s Hall at the top of  Regent Street, buzzed seven days a week with unprofitable ideas,  artistic aspirations and fatally entrapped wasps. No window was ever  opened, for fear of diluting the fug of inspiration. Elbow-patched  pianists in pursuit of unpaid fees jostled students and factory workers  waiting for last-minute penny tickets. Trilby-hatted newspapermen  interviewed stateless conductors in secluded corners--on one occasion,  apparently, in the left hand stall of the ladies\\' washroom where the  cistern drip-dripped so relentlessly that an idle wit attributed the  metronomic tempi of that night\\'s Tchaikovsky Fifth to the inadequacies  of Simmonds\\' plumbing.My father, hunched behind a pyramid of unread contracts and uncorrected  page-proofs, presided at all hours over his musical emporium, seldom  locking up before midnight. \\'I can\\'t leave the place empty,\\' he would  say. \\'Who knows when the next Kreisler might walk in?\\' Half a century  before open-plan offices, he took his door off its hinges, the better  to observe all comings and goings. No artist ever entered unnoticed. As  mail piled up and secretaries resigned in tears, my father juggled  three telephone receivers simultaneously, virtuosically and without  ever raising his voice.Mo...',\n",

       " '1570915105': 'Kindergarten-Grade 3-This fictional account surrounding the composition and naming of one of Bach\\'s most famous musical works tells the story of Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, an orphan who is one of the composer\\'s students. When the boy becomes a servant for Count Keyserlingk, he has no time to practice during the day, so he practices in the middle of the night. One night, the Count hears him and urges him to learn a new piece every week; first one filled with energy, then a canon, then a piece \"with everything.\" Desperate, the boy turns to his teacher, who plays his \"Variations,\" a complex composition that has a musical \"riddle\" hidden within it. The child practices it faithfully and by the end of the week, he plays it for the Count, who is so delighted that he names Goldberg the Court\\'s official harpsichordist and often calls out to him, \"Goldberg! Play your variations!\" A note explains that the origins of the piece are unclear, but it is known that Bach visited the count in Dresden in 1741 and shortly thereafter Goldberg began playing this composition. This accessible and readable story will lead young readers to find out more about both Bach and his young student. The watercolor illustrations, filled with period touches, give the lad an appealing personality as he struggles with his chores and his music. The four cherubs who adorn many of the pages add to the 18th-century tone as they echo both the sentiments and the music on the page.-Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\\tK-Gr. 3. Count Keyserlingk is brought to a church in Gdansk, Poland, by Bach in 1737 to hear a young orphan named Goldberg play the organ. Bach asks the count to care for the boy, who is placed in the count\\'s household and cadges time at the harpsichord when he can. When the sleepless count hears the boy practicing late one night, he asks him to play something \"that makes your heart pound and your fingers race.\" The boy doesn\\'t know anything like that, and the count gives him a week to learn something. In desperation, Goldberg goes to Bach, who imparts quite a bit of musical knowledge about the variations he offers. Goldberg becomes the official harpsichordist, a kitchen boy no longer. The candy-colored ink-and-watercolor illustrations are a bit stiff, with many little cupids in diapers flitting about. But the story is wonderfully told in the tropes and manner of a folktale. A CD is provided, and children may enjoy picking out all the things in the Goldberg Variations that Bach wants us to hear. An informative author\\'s note gives the history behind the story. GraceAnne DeCandidoCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved\\tWhen we think about classical music, the names of great composers often come to mind. But music history is as much about performers and listeners as it is about composers. The characters in this story really did exist. Count Keyserlingk, a Russian ambassador living in Dresden, first came in contact with Johann Gottlieb Goldberg (1727-1756) in 1737; he was so amazed by the boys talent that he offered him a position at court, where he was allowed to take music lessons with both Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.J. S. Bachs first biographer, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, reported that in the early 1740s Count Keyserlingk became ill and suffered sleepless nights. During these bouts of insomnia, Goldberg was often called upon to entertain the count with music. Scholars do not know the precise historical circumstances surrounding Goldbergs acquisition of Bachs composition. Some believe Count Keyserlingk commissioned the work; others propose that Bach gave the piece to Goldberg directly. Whatever the circumstances, it is known that Bach visited the count in Dresden in 1741 and that shortly thereafter Goldberg began playing the Goldberg Variations for Count Keyserlingk and his friends.The Goldberg Variations is unlike any other piece written by Bach. It is monumental in scope, extremely difficult to play, and unusual for its extended use of repetition. The theme and thirty variations present an assortment of musical styles: some variations are inspired by dance pieces or orchestral genres, while others take the form of a canon or fugue. The final variation, the musical riddle, is a genre called a quodlibet, which means whatever you please in Latin. Its a humorous collection of various tunes played at once.Today, some performers play the Goldberg Variations on piano. But it was originally composed for the harpsichord, as the piano had not yet been invented. The harpsichord resembles the piano in appearance, but it produces quite a different sound. Whereas the pianos sound is created by small hammers hitting the strings, the harpsichords sound is created by small hooks or quills that pluck the strings.When Bach published his impressive set of variations in 1742, he called them A Keyboard Practice Consisting of an Aria with Thirty Variations for the Harpsichord. Given the length of this title, we can see why the counts name for the piece, the Goldberg Variations, stuck more than 250 years ago and still remains popular today.

A hidden moon silvered chasms of cloud and offered a wan glow which silhouetted the jagged spikes of pine tops on the western horizon. The eastern sky was unclouded; a pit of blackness studded with the clean brightness of stars. The paths beneath the trees were dark, utter dark, a blackness in which long files of men cursed softly.The sun would rise to bring the steamy, breath-stealing heat of the full day; yet even now, in the night\\'s small hours, there was a close, stifling warmth that made the men sweat beneath their thick woolen coats. Red coats. The men were soldiers; six companies of Redcoats who followed their leaders through a wooded defile toward a tavern, a crossroads, and the enemy.A stream made its homely sound to the south, the wind rattled pine branches, while the night hordes of insects drowned whatever noise the nailed boots made on the dry and fallen needles. A whispered order was passed down the files of men. They stopped and crouched.Private Sam Gilpin\\'s hands were slick with sweat. His body prickled with the heat. A horse whinnied.It had to be an enemy\\'s horse, for the Redcoats had come on foot. Even the General was on foot. The sound told Sam that the enemy must be close, very close, and, despite the cloying warmth, he shivered suddenly.His musket would not fire. None of the soldiers\\' muskets would fire, for they had been ordered to unscrew the dog-heads and take out their flints. A musket without a flint could not spark the powder, so it could not fire a bullet, but nor could a careless man stumble in the dark and fire a shot which would warn the enemy.The Redcoats had come in the warm darkness, in silence, and the enemy was close.\"Follow!\" Again the order was a whisper. Sam\\'s company was led off the path into the blackness beneath the trees. Each man tried to walk silently, yet twigs snapped, dry pineneedles crunched together, and once a brass-bound musket butt crashed loud against a pine trunk.The sound made the men freeze, but no warning shout came from the enemy lines. Sam wondered if the enemy was waiting, awake and ready. Were their muskets loaded, flints drawn back, cocked to blast flames and smoke and death into the trees? His heart pounded heavy with the fear of a soldier before the killing. Sweat stung his eyes. It was hard to breathe the resinous air. The file moved again and Sam saw the smear of a red glow to his left and he knew it marked the enemy encampment.\"Down!\"Sam stopped, crouched. The redness was the remnant of a camp fire. There were other dying fires visible through the trees. The glowing embers revealed the shapes of dark buildings. Again a horse whinnied, but Sam could see no movement around the fires.\"Bayonets! Bayonets!\" The order was a hoarse whisper.Sam tugged his bayonet free of its scabbard. He had sharpened the blade to a wicked point in the dusk; now he slotted it over his musket\\'s muzzle and twisted it into place. The grease that kept the bayonet free of rust was sticky on his palm. All around him he could hear the scrape and click of blades being fixed and it seemed impossible for the enemy not to hear, but still there was no shout or musket flash. Sam took a leather lace from his ammunition pouch. He tied one end around the blade\\'s shoulder, and the other. he lashed to the musket\\'s sling-swivel. Now no enemy, could seize and wrench the blade away, nor, twisting the bayonet free of dead flesh, would he lose the weapon to a corpse.There was fear in Sam, but also exhilaration. He feared letting his comrades down, he feared Captain Kelly\\'s disappointment or Sergeant Scammell\\'s scorn, he feared his own fear, yet he also had the fire of a young man\\'s pride inside him. They were the redcoated Bloodybacks, the kings of the castle, cocks of the dungheap, and soldiers of the King, and in a moment they would be unleashed like rough-pelted hounds to tear and savage the King\\'s enemies.Footsteps sounded to his right and Sam saw the tall dark shape of Sergeant Scammell pacing along the company\\'s front. \"You\\'re not here to fucking dance with the buggers, you\\'re here to kill the fuckers. You hear me?\" Scammell\\'s voice was a mere whisper, but still fearsome. Few men in the company liked Scammell, but even those who hated him were glad of his presence this night, for, in the confusion of battle, the Sergeant displayed a chilling efficiency. The embers of the enemy\\'s camp fires reflected dull red on the steel of Scammell\\'s seventeen-inch bayonet.Sam fingered his own greased blade. It was a threesided bayonet, channeled to release blood so that the blade would not stick in flesh. It was not a weapon for cutting, but for stabbing. \"Go for their bellies or throats,\" Scammell was whispering. \"Don\\'t tickle the bastards, kill diem!\"Captain Kelly and Ensign Trumbull had their sabres drawn. The two officers stood at the edge of the trees, staring at the enemy. Kelly was tall, quiet, and liked by the men Trumbull was thirteen, a schoolboy given an officer\\'s coat: and despised. Sam saw the small twitching of the Ensign\\'s sabre blade and knew the boy was nervous.Sam\\'s twin brother was Also nervous. \"You\\'ll stay Close, Sam?\" Nate asked.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tHayward Morse is unable to transform Cornwell\\'s epic of revolutionary Philadelphia into a gripping story. While Morse is good at narrating action, the number of characters and lines of dialogue overwhelm him. The voices of his  female characters are nasal or quivery, sometimes both at the same time. Two of the women in the novel are supposed to be Rebel spies, but they\\'re not believable without strong voices. Several of the battle and primitive surgery scenes are gruesome.

Buy it now!\\tBumpin' Uglies are more than just a wacky 3 piece band from San Diego, it's about not taking anything too seriously. It's about screwing off, having a good time, playing parties for beer, cooking up bacon for hungry bar patrons, serving up flapjacks for late night concert goers, or getting a fan to eat pigs feet and clam juice. Why be miserable when you could be having a good time? And they are Having defeated the twirly dancing hippies in Northern California, Bumpin' Uglies are poised to show the rest of the world what happens when you mix the rhythmic and intricate bass of Les Claypool (Primus) with the ska/punk guitar of Bradley Nowell (Sublime) and the driving riffs of Stephen Egerton (Descendents) on top of high speed precision drumming reminiscent of Danny Carey (Tool) and Stuart Copeland (Police). The uglies are truly unique in their widespread appeal to audiences of all ages, backgrounds, and musical bias due to their dynamic style that alternates between i! ntricate melodies and heavy rhythms combined with catchy riffs and humorous lyrics. Jeremy Fritschy is an incredibly talented musician and songwriter, the kind that only comes along every decade or so. While he's dominating the electric and stand-up bass he's singing lyrics about poignant societal issues such as flashers, fish & chips, white trash, hangovers, and marinating. Jeremy's true gift is his animated stage presence and ability to get the audience bumpin' their uglies all around. Jeremy is a master bassist, he's been slapping it for over 9 years. Known for his intense, all-encompassing love of bacon, he is a graduate of California State University, Chico where he studied recording arts. James Dolan is a music machine; there isn't a moment when he is not thinking about, playing, listening, singing, or writing music. He is revered for his innovative and complex guitar techniques and stylings. His iron lungs belt out backup vocals that make little children run to their mo! thers. James turned to music and booze at the ripe age of 11 and hasn't stopped playing since. He graduated from Chico State with a degree in communications. Dave Krogle is a musical savant and can play anything on any instrument. He finds true meaning in delivering unique, double bass lined beats unto his fellow man. Dave's drumming ranges from subtle to intense, rounding out the sound with a solid beat that carries the music. Dave has been a musician for over 15 years and a drummer for 7 years. Formed in Chico, a small college town in Northern California in early 1997, Bumpin' Uglies have established a fan base throughout California, and a reputation for putting on some of the best live shows around. Their independent record label, Ugly Music released their full-length debut album, What the Hell? in March of 1998. Then came the compilations like Chico City Limits II & III and You're from Where? In March 2000, the much-awaited 2nd album, Ridiculosis was released to the herds!  of screaming fans throughout California.Jeremy Fritschy, Bass & Vocals James Dolan, Guitar & Backup Vocals Dave Krogle, Drums & Backup Vocals\\tIf it sucks then it's not Ugly Music.

       " '0809325284': \"The legal challenge mounted by Richard and Mildred Loving, convicted in the 1950s of violating Virginia's ban on interracial marriage, led to the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that antimiscegenation laws were unconstitutional. Newbeck, an attorney, examines this landmark case in the context of laws banning interracial marriage before and after Loving. But the most compelling part of this legal history is the personal recollections of a member of the Loving family, who had previously maintained public silence on the issue. Drawing also on interviews with attorneys who argued for and against such bans, Newbeck brings personal perspectives to the history, sociology, and politics of banning interracial marriage. She places the fervor over banning interracial liaisons within the context of historical sexual and racial politics and issues of social activism and family dynamics; and she places the Loving case specifically within the context of the civil rights struggle. This is an informative and insightful look at legal attempts to regulate marriage and is particularly timely given the current public debate about gay marriage. Vernon FordCopyright  American Library Association. All rights reserved\\tPhyl Newbecks Virginia Hasnt Always Been for Lovers is a clearly written, accessible, well-organized, and remarkably researched history of the path-breaking Loving case. It also stands as a comprehensive history of legal efforts to enforce antimiscegenation laws and their ultimate demise. Of particular interest is Newbecks seemingly indefatigable effort to interview everyone involved in Loving and other significant cases and her assiduous efforts to track down the documentary record.Michael Meltsner, Harvard Law School and Northeastern Law SchoolVirginia Hasnt Always Been for Lovers is quite correct to take the hypocrisy of this state to task. It was all right for white men to congress with black women, as long as the white men didnt marry their dusky lovers. Richard and Mildred Loving challenged that hypocrisy. And brought a candle to the dark tower of race hatred. That Virginia is for loving. And there are next steps to be taken.Nikki Giovanni, poet, Virginia Tech UniversityNewbecks exploration of the antimiscegenation laws in America touches the very core of racial discrimination and race hatred in America: sexual intimacy between races. Using the Lovings as the tale-telling prism, she does an excellent job of illuminating the dreadful lifeand happy deathof these racist laws and folkways.Howard Ball, author of Murder in Mississippi\\tA graduate of Barnard College and New York Law School, Phyl Newbeck is a licensed attorney and the director of the Vermont Teacher Diversity Scholarship Program.\",\n",

In 1939, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson advocated an urgent expansion of the Air Force in an attempt to match the strength of rival countries. Air Corps responded to the call by producing 50,000 warplanes per year. During this period, the Navy too, undertook an expansion program acquiring 6 new aircraft carriers. Nominally dedicated to a Germany-driven strategy, the Army Air Forces began a slow buildup of bomber strength in England in anticipation of the strategic air campaign against the Third Reich.  By the late 30's, Boeing had developed a revolutionary four-engine heavy bomber to meet military specifications and this became known as the B 17 Flying Fortress. It was to be the weapon which the USAAF relied on to press forward with its strategy of daylight high altitude precision bombing by unescorted, but heavily armed, bombers. The more powerful B 29s, better known as the Super Fortresses, later overshadowed the B 17, especially in the Pacific sector.  The new system of combined strategic air-operations served the Allies very well through the height of the war, as the 9th Air Force was able to provide extremely effective air support to the Allied armies driving across Western Europe especially after the arrival of powerful fighter-bombers such as the P 47 Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, B 17s and B 24s of the 8th Air Force maintained their strategic bombing campaign against German industry and morale, augmented by long-range fighter escorts such as the P 38 Lightning and P 51 Mustang.

       " '0130878286': 'Preface   Today\\'s college algebra students are a diverse group. Some are going on into precalculus, calculus, or other math sequences, whereas others will complete their math requirements with this course. This text is designed and written to help both sets of students succeed. The book has three fundamental goals: First, to help students acquire a solid foundation in college algebra, preparing them for other college courses such as calculus, business calculus, finite mathematics, and computer science; second, to show students how algebra can model and solve authentic real-world problems; and third, to enable students to develop problem-solving skills, fostering critical thinking within a varied and interesting setting.   Writing The Second Edition   A source of frustration for me and my colleagues is that very few students read their textbook. When I ask students why they do not take full advantage of the text, their responses generally fall into two categories:\"I cannot follow the explanations.\"  \"The applications are not interesting.\"    I thought about both of these objections in writing every page of the Second Edition.    \"I can\\'t follow the explanations.\" For many of my students, textbook explanations are too compressed. The chapters in the Second Edition have been extensively rewritten to make them more accessible. I have paid close attention to ensuring that the amount of detail and depth of coverage is appropriate for a liberal arts college algebra course. Every section has been rewritten to contain a better range of simple, intermediate, and challenging examples. Voice balloons allow for more specific annotations in examples, further clarifying procedures and concepts. A more open format with a softer color palette gives the book a less crowded look than the First Edition.    \"The applications are not interesting.\" One of the things I enjoy most about teaching in a large urban community college is the diversity of who my students are and what interests them. Real-world data that celebrate this variety are used to bring relevance to examples, discussions, and applications. All data from the previous edition have been replaced to include data that extend as far up to the present as possible. I selected all updated real-world data to be interesting and intriguing to students. By connecting algebra to the whole spectrum of their interests, it is my intent to show students that their world is profoundly mathematical and, indeed, pi is in the sky.

Filled with scenarios, examples, study tips, exercises, etc., it takes the intimidation out of learning algebra, and gets readers up to speed quickly and painlessly.  Prerequisites: Fundamental Concepts of Algebra. Equations, Inequalities, and Mathematical Models. Functions and Graphs. Polynomial and Rational Functions. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions. Systems of Equations and Inequalities. Matrices and Determinants. Conic Sections. Sequences, Induction, and Probability.  For anyone wanting a user-friendly introduction to college algebra.\\tPreface   Today\\'s college algebra students are a diverse group. Some are going on into precalculus, calculus, or other math sequences, whereas others will complete their math requirements with this course. This text is designed and written to help both sets of students succeed. The book has three fundamental goals: First, to help students acquire a solid foundation in college algebra, preparing them for other college courses such as calculus, business calculus, finite mathematics, and computer science; second, to show students how algebra can model and solve authentic real-world problems; and third, to enable students to develop problem-solving skills, fostering critical thinking within a varied and interesting setting.   Writing The Second Edition   A source of frustration for me and my colleagues is that very few students read their textbook. When I ask students why they do not take full advantage of the text, their responses generally fall into two categories:    \"I cannot follow the explanations.\"  \"The applications are not interesting.\"    I thought about both of these objections in writing every page of the Second Edition.    \"I can\\'t follow the explanations.\" For many of my students, textbook explanations are too compressed. The chapters in the Second Edition have been extensively rewritten to make them more accessible. I have paid close attention to ensuring that the amount of detail and depth of coverage is appropriate for a liberal arts college algebra course. Every section has been rewritten to contain a better range of simple, intermediate, and challenging examples. Voice balloons allow for more specific annotations in examples, further clarifying procedures and concepts. A more open format with a softer color palette gives the book a less crowded look than the First Edition.    \"The applications are not interesting.\" One of the things I enjoy most about teaching in a large urban community college is the diversity of who my students are and what interests them. Real-world data that celebrate this variety are used to bring relevance to examples, discussions, and applications. All data from the previous edition have been replaced to include data that extend as far up to the present as possible. I selected all updated real-world data to be interesting and intriguing to students. By connecting algebra to the whole spectrum of their interests, it is my intent to show students that their world is profoundly mathematical and, indeed, pi is in the sky.

Paddy Carmody (Robert Mitchum) loves being \"someone whose home is where the sun goes down,\" but his wife (Deborah Kerr) and teenage son are tired of the nomadic life and want to settle down. Director Fred Zinnemann (From Here to Eternity) takes a wonderfully laid-back approach to this likable material, emphasizing the refreshingly grown-up relationship between Mitchum and Kerr as well as the stark scenic attractions of Australia--a continent that, in 1960, was still unfamiliar terrain for the movies. Puckish, portly Peter Ustinov provides the lion\\'s share of the comic relief. One of the high points is a sheep-shearing sequence (the normally self-assured Mitchum was so nervous about accidentally harming an animal that he required a few bottles of beer for fortification before shooting the scene).

       " 'B00005IAT5': 'Alongside larger-scaled epics, this 1945 drama looks modest, but director Lewis Milestone achieves a gritty realism that is ultimately closer to the truth of combat. A World War I veteran, Milestone had already created a classic war film--and powerful antiwar statement--in 1930\\'s All Quiet on the Western Front, focusing on German troops in the trenches during \"the Great War.\" For obvious reasons, A Walk in the Sun views the action from the perspective of American troops, but Milestone and a strong cast headed by Dana Andrews and Richard Conte prove remarkably clear-eyed in this chronicle of a platoon moving through the Italian countryside following the successful, but bloody, invasion of Italy. There\\'s little of the cheerleading fervor or reflexive demonizing of the enemy visible in other films from the period; instead, the men\\'s treacherous odyssey captures the sense of random chaos as their bucolic trek is interrupted by sudden skirmishes. We\\'re shown the deep bonds forged between the soldiers, the loss of innocence that is the inevitable price of combat experience, and the capricious fates that can spare one soldier while exterminating another. Milestone would extend his mastery of wartime fiction to include the Korean War, captured in the equally fine, equally sobering Pork Chop Hill. --Sam Sutherland',\n",

Shreeve, coauthor with famed paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson of Lucy\\'s Child, pieces together an absorbing speculative portrait of Neandertals, buttressed by interviews with geneticists, anthropologists and archeologists in France, Israel, Zaire, South Africa and the former Czechoslovakia. He suggests that Neandertals possessed rudimentary language and recognized nature spirits but that the males and females lived apart, mateless. By contrast, early modern hunter-gatherers evolved a \"sex contract\" whereby women secured for themselves the continuing economic services of a spouse. Shreeve also ponders why Neandertals dwindled to extinction around 30,000 years ago, after apparently coexisting with more anatomically advanced humans for tens of thousands of years in the Near East. He deduces that language played a key role in the intergroup cooperation that led to Upper Paleolithic humans\\' sudden creative explosion in symbol, art and technology some 40,000 years ago. Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\t      --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\tSearching for the relation between those muscle-bound, thick-browed, knuckle-dragging neandertals (author\\'s spelling) and Homo sapiens, science journalist Shreeve traveled the world but found no certainties. Instead, he discovered raging academics carrying on their controversies with bare-knuckle intensity. At stake is an explanation of why the neandertals disappeared about 35,000 years ago: Were they wiped out by humans streaming out of Africa, or did the two groups meld into each other? Known as the replacement-versus-continuity debate, its resolution depends on inferences made from fossils, artifacts, and DNA analysis, which Shreeve clearly and enthusiastically explains, based on talks with experts at the principal dig sites. Following his informed speculation about what might have characterized the neandertal-human encounter in the Levant and in Europe, readers will conclude that Shreeve favors continuity. In such a fluid field, where a new discovery can upend everything, as did the \"Lucy\" fossil about which he previously wrote (Lucy\\'s Child, 1989), Shreeve\\'s guarded views should appeal to readers seeking a solid overview of humanity\\'s possible neandertal ancestry.

Miller\\tThe authors of this broadside, both civil libertarians, regard campus speech codes against racist, sexist or homophobic language, as well as multicultural \"diversity education\" programs, as coercive \"academic thought reform.\" Political correctness at U.S. colleges and universities, they maintain, has led to the emergence of a \"shadow university\" as administrators, dormitory advisers and officers of student life treat students not as individuals, but as embodiments of abstract groups. Traversing a minefield of thorny issues with passionate conviction, Kors, a University of Pennsylvania history professor, and Silverglate, a criminal defense attorney, charge that the \"political and cultural left\" is today the worst abuser of the principles of open, equal free speech. They argue that a double standard prevails, whereby self-appointed progressives censor voices deemed offensive to women, feminists, gays, ethnic or racial minorities, while these same \"progressives\" condone equally offensive speech directed against conservatives, religious Christians and others. What distinguishes this outspoken contribution to a contentious national debate already clotted with combatants is the authors\\' scathing campus-by-campus tour, documenting what they see as repressive speech codes, sweeping notions of sexual harassment and arbitrary disciplinary hearings against students and faculty that lack due process protection. The authors\\' well-nigh absolutist defense of robust free speech?even when its content is viciously racist or otherwise hateful?guarantees that their brief will be controversial. Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tKors (history, Univ. of Pennsylvania) and Silverglate, a Boston trial attorney and ACLU associate, contend that U.S. academia?where free thought should flourish?is now governed by a regime of \"political correctness.\" This view has not been news since Allan Bloom\\'s The Closing of the American Mind (LJ 5/1/87). Kors and Silverglate ostensibly are interested not in the partisan politics surrounding campus speech controversies but rather in establishing the universal desirability of pure free speech in universities today. Their neutrality is suspiciously selective. Group identity is repeatedly ridiculed precisely because it privileges ethnicity or gender over individuality. Yet, in these restricted speech cases, individual members of a certain \"interest group\" (say, \"feminists\") are largely assumed to overreact to the casually obnoxious simply because overreaction is endemic to that group. Still, the most extreme speech that the authors defend comes not out of the mouths of white bigots but rather from black nationalist professors. Although this is an important acquisition for academic libraries, the most reasoned critique of PC remains Todd Gitlin\\'s The Twilight of Common Dreams (LJ 11/15/95).?Scott H. Silverman, Bryn Mawr Coll. Lib., Upper Darby, PACopyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tEven chemistry majors are learning politics at American universities these days. But the type of politics they are learning does not impress Kors and Silverglate, since it entails the establishment of a left-leaning political orthodoxy and the systematic suppression of dissent. The authors document in alarming detail the Orwellian techniques universities now use to enforce conformity--vague and self-contradictory speech codes; secretive and arbitrary disciplinary proceedings; ideological indoctrination billed as sensitivity training; censorship of conservative publications and speakers. Besides shaking readers out of their complacency, the tales of abuse lend urgency to their call for renewed openness on college campuses. Only such openness, the authors warn, can restore the First Amendment rights lost to students and professors under the thumb of groupthink inquisitors. And because of the university\\'s culture-shaping power, all of society stands at risk unless such rights are restored. Fortunately, the authors conclude their sobering diagnosis with a promising prescription of practical policies for academics committed to safeguarding campus liberties. So long as campus zealots wage war against independent thought, librarians will see strong demand for this book.  Bryce Christensen\\tTwo civil libertarians take up the cudgels against political correctness in speech codes at American colleges and universities. Kors is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania who represented a student - charged with shouting the epithet - water buffalo -  at members of a black sorority having a rowdy party in a dormitory courtyard - in his intramural battle with the university. And Silverglate is a civil liberties litigator and legal columnist from Massachusetts. They take the egregious ``Water Buffalo Affair\\'\\' of 1993 as the jumping-off point for a wide-ranging, detailed, and legally informed study of how universities and colleges supposedly ride roughshod over First Amendment rights in the interest of curbing hate speech. Their study, while often stimulating and revealing, undermines its own credibility with hysterical rhetoric: ``Universities have become the enemy of a free society, and it is time for the citizens of that society to recognize this scandal of enormous proportions and hold these institutions to account.\\'\\' How did we come to this desperate pass? ``Whole departments of the liberal arts have been given to those for whom the universities represent, in their own minds, the revolutionary agency of culture.\\'\\' Kors and Silverglate round up the usual suspects, but the late Herbert Marcuse - icon of the 1960s New Left - comes in for a special drubbing. With grudging admiration, they propose that his views on the limiting of free speech paved the way for Richard Delgado, Charles R. Lawrence III, Mari Matsuda, Catharine MacKinnon, and Stanley Fish, all of whom wish to curtail free speech in the interest of race and gender equality. The authors put academic freedom in historical perspective and offer illuminating observations about double standards and about the universities\\' relationship to the courts, but the exaggeratedly polemical posturing undermines the reader\\'s confidence in their objectivity. While in many ways a fine and learned study, Kors and Silverglate\\'s hellfire-and-brimstone sermon will likely be heeded only by the saved.   -- Copyright 1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The women were singing very loudly, chanting, and stomping. It had prevented himfrom writing, and it had awakened his roommate. He shouted out the window, \"Please keep quiet,\" and went back to work. Twenty minutes later, the noise yet louder, heshouted out the window, \"Shut up, you water buffalo! \" The women were singing about going to a party. \"If you want a party,\" he shouted, \"there\\'s a zoo a mile from here.\"The women were black. Within weeks, the administrative judicial inquiry officer (JIO) in charge of Eden\\'s, case, Robin Read, decided to prosecute him for violation of Penn\\'spolicy on racial harassment. He could accept a \"settlement\"- an academic plea bargain or he could face a judicial hearing whose possible sanctions included suspension andexpulsion. The JIO\\'s finding that there was \"reasonable cause\" to believe that Eden had violated Penn\\'s racial harassment policy for having shouted \"Shut up, you water buffalo!\" tolate-night noisemakers under his window was outrageous in terms of normal human interactions at a university. Loud and raucous festivites had occurred beneath thewindows of student since the Middle Ages. For centuries, would-be scholars, disturbed or awakened in the still hours, had shouted their various and picturesque disapprovalsat the celebrants. \"Water buffalo\" would have been one of the mildest such epithets ever uttered.The JIO\\'s decision also was unconscionable given the history of the debates over speech codes at Penn. In 1987, over the strenuous objections of a handful of professors,Sheldon Hackney, president of the University of \\'Pennsylvania, promulgated the university\\'s first modern-era restrictions on speech, in the form of prohibitions on \"anybehavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes individuals on the basis of race, ethnic or national origin ... and that has the purpose or effect of interfering with anindividual\\'s academic or work performance; and/or creates an intimidating or offensive academic, living, or work environment.\" In September 1989, to explain the policy toincoming students, the administration gave specific examples of what would constitute the serious crime of \"harassment\": students who drew a poster to advertise a \"South ofthe Border\" party, showing a \"lazy\" Mexican taking a siesta against a wall; a faculty member who referred to blacks as \"ex-slaves\"; and students who, in protest of \"Gay JeansDay\" (when undergraduates were asked to dress in jeans to show solidarity with gay and lesbian students), held a satiric sign proclaiming \"Heterosexual Footwear Day.\"There were ironies in this presentation of \"incidents of harassment.\" When Louis Farrakhan spoke at Penn in 1988, over the protests of several Jewish organizations,Hackney issued a statement in which he conceded that Farrakhan\\'s statements were \"racist, and antiseptic, and amount to scape-goating:\\' but concluded: \"In an academiccommunity, open expression is the most important value. We can\\'t have free speech only some of the time, for only some people. Either we have it, or we don\\'t. At Penn, wehave it.\"  Indeed, in the very month that his administration was prohibiting social criticism of Gay jeans Day and posters of sleeping Mexicans, Hackney was campaigning, togreat national applause, against Senator Jesse Helms\\'s efforts to deny federal funding, by the National Endowment for the Arts, of works such as Andres Serrano\\'s \"Piss Christ:\\' a crucifix immersed in the artist\\'s urine. According to Hackney, it was impossible \\'\\'to cleanse public discourse of offensive material\" without producing \"an Orwelliannightmare\" or the horror of \"self-censorship.\" We were not, in Hackney\\'s words, \"Beijing\" (an argument put to him earlier against his own speech code), but the \"Land ofLiberty,\" where efforts \"to limit expression\" deemed \"offensive\" violated the essence and spirit of \"democracy\" and made social \"satire\" impossible.The debate over the harassment policy had heated up at Penn in 1989-90, however, because, of a federal court decision. Despite the university\\'s private status, which placed itoutside the sway of the Bill of Rights, the administration always had insisted that its speech code could pass constitutional muster. In 1989, however, a federal district courtdeclared the University of Michigan\\'s code, which was less restrictive than Penn\\'s, to be unconstitutional. It embarrassed Hackney when his critics now pointed out thatstudents at Pennsylvania State University or at local community colleges had more rights of free expression than students at the University of Pennsylvania. Accepting theadvice of a professor of law to change Penn\\'s overbroad, vague, and imprecise restrictions, and declaring that they were interested in prohibiting merely \"words used asweapons,\" Penn\\'s administration promulgated a \"narrower\" prohibition of \"offensive\" speech. The new code specified three conditions which, if met simultaneously, wouldconstitute verbal harassment. This was the definition governing Eden Jacobowitz\\'s case:Any verbal or symbolic behavior that:1. is directed at an identifiable person or persons; and   2. insults or demeans the person or persons to whom the behavior - is directed, or abuses a power relationship with that person, on the basis of his or her race, color,ethnicity, or national origin, such as (but not limited to) by the use of slurs, epithets, hate words, demeaning jokes, or derogatory stereotypes; and3.  is intended by the speaker or actor only to inflict direct injury on the person or persons to whom the behavior is directed, or is sufficiently abusive or demeaning that areasonable, disinterested observer would conclude .that the behavior is so intended; or occurs in a context such that an intent only to inflict direct injury may reasonably beinferred.   \\t      --This text refers to the \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaperback\\t edition.',\n",

And don\\'t be disturbed if your neighbor, unprovided, drips and splatters all over you. For this time the comic muse very frequently gives way to tears. This time Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, whose previous cinematic marriages have been more or less on the frivolous and nicely indecent side, are so blissfully and properly united that it takes a tragedy to threaten briefly to tear them apart. This time the new picture is Columbia\\'s \"\"Penny Serenade.\"\"When you think about it coolly and dispassionatelyand after an interval of at least an houryou can\\'t help but feel that somebody has slipped a fast one over on you. Maybe it is Producer George Stevens, who has put together a film which employs not one but six or seven of the recognized sob-story tricks. Maybe it is Miss Dunne, who originally succumbs to one of the most severe cases of galloping nostalgia we have ever witnessed on the screen. And maybe it is Mr. Grant, that worldly and jocular chap, who shamelessly permits a tiny tot to play \"\"Home, Sweet Home\"\" on his heart-strings. The thing is you never suspect these people are going quite so soft on you untilbam!they are wallowing in sentiment and your eyes are leaking like a sieve.But that\\'s the way it is. From the moment that Miss Dunne sadly turns on the old gramaphone and, to the plaintive strains of \"\"You Were Meant for Me,\"\" the scene fades back to her first meeting with Mr. Grant, you may recognize that you are in for a reminiscent wrench. Then, as she successively replenishes the music box with such nostalgic tunes as \"\"Just a Memory,\"\" \"\"Missouri Waltz,\"\" \"\"Poor Butterfly,\"\" \"\"Blue Heaven,\"\" etc., right out of a book, you follow the couple as they marry, suffer countless little woes, buy a country newspaper, adopt a baby and finally lose the child they love so much.And slowly, without being aware of it, you drift with them and the film from brittle, sophisticated comedy to out-and-out softy stuff, from the quixotic plighting of their troth at a New Year\\'s Eve party to the first fearful bathing of baby in the familiar new-parents comedy vein. And then you are sniffling and gulping as little daughter takes part in her first school play and you know that the teacher\\'s promise that she can be \"\"an angel next year\"\" is irony. Somehow, it all goes down, despite a woefully overlong scriptall but Mr. Grant\\'s recalcitrance after the little one is gone. It\\'s hard to believe that a man could treat his ever-loving wife so wretchedly, at a time when both would be drawn even closer together by grief. And their sudden joyful willingness to adopt another child is open to doubt.But some very credible acting on the part of Mr. Grant and Miss Dunne is responsible in the main for the infectious quality of the film. Edgar Buchanan, too, gives an excellent performance as a good-old-Charlie friend, and Beulah Bondi is sensible as an orphanage matron. Heart-warming is the word for both of them. As a matter of fact, the whole picture deliberately cozies up to the heart. Noel Coward once drily observed how extraordinarily potent cheap music is.

       " 'B000MV9OHW': 'In the most dignified way possible, \"Dignity\"--the title track to this fizz-bomb of a dance-pop disc--sends a disgusted eye-roll and a flagrant puh-lease to underwear-eschewing celebutantes everywhere: \"You\\'d show up to the opening of an envelope,\" sings Duff, who hangs onto her signature sweetness despite having entered full-on diss mode. \"It\\'s not news when you\\'ve got a new bag/It\\'s not news when you\\'re looking your best/Come on, give it a rest.\" Well said. And sung. Not that calling out the phony and the full of it is what Duff, or Dignity, is all about. Mostly, the disc is a beat-studded chronicling of an incredibly healthy 19-year-old psyche: On \"Happy,\" she\\'s happy despite an ex\\'s attempts to make her miserable; on \"With Love\"--maybe her catchiest, most grown-up song to date--she\\'s willing to accept rejection as long as kindness plays a role in its delivery. Musically, with the help of groove-conscious producers like Tim  Bob and Will.i.am, Duff edges ever closer to adult sensibilities; her goofball Lizzie McGuire days seem far behind. It\\'s an evolution anybody could have seen coming, actually. Has there ever been a starlet with her head on straighter? --Tammy La Gorce\\tDignity isn\\'t for sale. It comes from within. Hilary Duff has always carried herself with dignity, from her 2001 TV debut starring in \"Lizzy McGuire,\" through big screen hits like \"Cinderella Story\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen,\" to her career as a multi-platinum recording artist, with more than 13 million albums sold to date. Now Hilary brings her customary class and splash to her new Hollywood Records CD \"Dignity.  At 19, Hilary has matured into a sophisticated singer and songwriter. Hilary has co-written all the songs on \\'Dignity\\', always aiming high and ultimately creating an album of depth and consequence. To realize her vision for the new CD, she teamed with Grammy-Award winning Kara Dioguardi ( Gwen Stefani, Pussy Cat Dolls, Enrique Iglesias, Kelly Clarkson), as well as top producer/songwriters like Chico Bennett & Richard Vission (Madonna, Usher, Killers), Tim & Bob (Nas, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez), Vada Nobles (Rhianna, Lauryn Hill, Faith Evans, Natasha Bedingfield, Warren G), Fredwrecke (Snoop Dog, Eminem, Fergi) Will.I.Am and Rhett Lawrence. In the title track, she talks about her experiences and observations of living in Los Angeles (\"Where\\'s your dignity/I think you lost it in the Hollywood Hills\"). \"Danger\" explores the suspect advances of an older man, while \"With Love\" turns the world\\'s most common song topic upside down. (\"I can take your honesty/All your words weigh heavily/I\\'m listening to you all the time\"). The song \\'Stranger\\' reveals a relationship that is picture perfect in public, but cold behind closed doors. With every track, Hilary probes life and love more intensely, and with more vulnerability than she has before.  This is the standard version.',\n",

There are interviews with McConkey, who comes off as the laidback dude one might expect, as well as interviews with his mother and a few friends (one of whom tells a funny story proving that \"there\\'s something wrong with McConkey\"). And a few comic interludes, including McConkey\\'s attempt to star in a music video, pop up. But the real point to this production is the skiing footage, which is uniformly spectacular. McConkey and others (including Olympic champion Jonny Moseley) go rocketing down absurdly steep mountainsides in footage shot from helicopters, and of course they make it all seem so effortless that you can almost forget how insanely dangerous it is. And speaking of bodily peril, McConkey is also seen flying off ski jumping ramps backwards and gleefully sailing through space. As someone quips, \"his radness can\\'t be quantified.\" Keeping with the athlete-as-outlaw theme, there are also segments on BASE jumping, in which McConkey and others are seen parachuting from bridges, tall buildings, and mountainsides.

Yet the roses we grow today have generally been in existence for less than a century, and English roses--in spite of the traditional-sounding name--have all been developed since the 1950s by rosarian David Austin in an effort to combine the fragrance and beauty of old roses and the frequent blooming habit of modern hybrids. 100 English Roses for the American Garden presents those English roses best suited to the diverse North American climate. As the curator of rose collections at the Huntington Botanical Gardens, author Clair G. Martin knows his roses. With a large section devoted to general rose care (mulching, composting, container growing, and cutting) and individual pages (each, of course, depicting a single perfect rose) detailing the availability, stature and habit, usage, and disease susceptibility of each variety in various climates, this is an enjoyable and useful introduction to a fragrant subject.\\tThis represents the first book written on growing English roses in this country. Martin selects reliable cultivars for Americans and covers all the basics of planting and maintenance.

Requiring neither the meticulous care nor prodigious amount of chemicals that are the bane of many rose plants, the English rose is a hybrid with rare character and simplicity.  Both a how-to and field guide to these extraordinary roses, this simple, commonsense approach to raising them begins by suggesting the most disease-resistant cultivars and showing how to give them easy, consistent care. The field guide section of the book features 100 English roses best suited for American gardens, lushly photographed and organized by color and height.  Photographs by Saxon Holt  57,000 copies in print.\\tEasier to raise and care for than many gardeners believe, English Roses have spearheaded a new movement toward reinstating the rose as a natural part of the garden landscape. Unlike their high-maintenance counterparts, English Roses require no more than the basics-sun, soil, water, and food. And with their fountain-like shapes, soft pastel colors, an memorable fragrance, they blend artfully into almost any garden's overall design.This reference shows North American Gardeners just how to meet their English Roses' needs. From the straightforward presentation of sound and simple horticultural practices that ensure healthy, blooming plants to the full-color, cultivar-by-cultivar guide-cover suitability, stature and habit, uses, and moreit's a complete grower's resource.\\tClair G.

       " '0613253272': 'Grade 4-7-Standard tales of ancient and 20th-century encounters are paired with stock photos of evidence. The Himalayan yeti and North American Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, are most commonly discussed in similar books; featured sections of reports on the \"Wildman\" of China and the \"Almas\" of Asia are unique to Beasts. While eyewitness accounts and footprint evidence of these creatures are much like those of the yeti and Bigfoot, the description of a female Almas, named Zana, who purportedly lived among humans in the 19th century, is particularly fascinating. The usual explanations for reports of large, hairy humans are presented. This is a good, simple overview of an endlessly controversial topic. Millennium Prophecies draws on Edgar Cayce, hidden Bible codes, Nostradamus, astrologers, and the Great Pyramid at Giza, plus two Irish prophets and the Book of Revelations. It opens with an explanation of the different major types of calendars and dating systems that do not coincide with the Christian calendar\\'s millennium. Unlike Daniel Cohen\\'s Prophets of Doom (Millbrook, 1999), this title just presents the prophecies and leaves readers to judge whether or not they will come true. Cohen\\'s tone is more reassuring.

       " '0312252064': 'Andreae brings to her fourth thriller even more of the high tension, dark mystery and tight plotting that earned her a 1995 Edgar Award nomination for Trail of Murder. Set in the midst of a raging forest fire in the rugged mountains of Montana, this gripping tale pits a hard-boiled female firefighter against roaring flames, gender hostility, professional jealousy, political interference and a murderous, psychotic arsonist. Mattie McCulloch is the first female Forest Service firefighter to command a major firefighting effort. The Justice Peak blaze is out of control and so are some male co-workers, the media and a colony of gun-toting nudists. To add to her problems, Mattie\\'s son, Jimmy, is on one of the hotshot fire crews, and the man she replaces as the on-scene commander hates her guts. Then Jimmy\\'s crew is overwhelmed and wiped out by a suspicious wildfire, and tragedy turns to murder when arson is indicated and Jimmy\\'s body cannot be found. Despite her best efforts to keep a stiff upper lip, Mattie is fired for political reasons, and her career is jeopardized. Undeterred, she vows to find the murderer and is aided by a wise, weatherbeaten state cop and a gimpy, tormented journalist whose life Mattie saved in a forest fire 20 years earlier. The arsonist is watching, however, and soon Mattie and everyone else is in grave danger. Packed with suspense, action, drama, convincing characters and, best of all, boasting a tightly woven plot with clever foreshadowing and no loose ends, this is the consummate nail-biter. Andreae is a skilled writer whose prose pounds the senses: flames leap, trees pop, heat sears and the smell of smoke suffuses the tale. (Feb.) Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tFlame-haired Matilda \"Matty\" McCullough has never wanted anything but a career fighting fires. The daughter of two veteran firefighters and mother of another (Jimmy is a member of the elite Millville Hotshots), Matty lands the high command of the Justice Peak fire in Montana. Now in her forties and anxious to begin living her dream, Matty gets whisked into a volatile media circus when arson on a mountainside claims the lives of five young firefighters, one of whom may be Jimmy. Forced to swallow her grief and take charge, Matty unexpectedly and ironically falls in love. Journal entries kept by the arsonist are spliced between hair-raising chapters, building suspense and giving readers a quick glimpse into the sicko\\'s mind. Andreae was nominated for the Edgar Award for 1992\\'s Trail of Murder. Literate and fast-paced, this is a good choice for most fiction collections.-Susan A. Zappia, Paradise Valley Community Coll., Phoenix Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.\\tMontana\\'s Justice Peak is ablaze, and Andreae\\'s vivid prose enables the reader to feel the heat, hear the crackle of the flames, taste the smoke, and smell the ashes. Her protagonist, Mattie McCulloch, is the first female Incident Commander, the head honcho, at a major fire site. Mattie, divorced for years and with her only son on the fire line, feels she has to prove herself to every man and woman there as well as to her son, her retired father, and an old friend, investigative reporter Gerry Spencer. As if the fire itself is not a tough enough foe, Mattie also has to deal with political types with their own agendas and a hostile group of armed nudists who refuse to leave their fire-threatened land. The author ices Mattie\\'s perilous cake with a fire-fighting arsonist who gets his sexual kicks from the damage he does. This is well-written entertainment with plenty of action, serious suspense, and even a few slow-roasted red herrings.  Budd Arthur\\tTheres a monster fire at Justice Peak, Montana, and it belongs to Matty McCullough. Three years after she qualified for high command, the powers that be have finally, in her phrase, let her off the bench. Firefighters who are also women have it easier these days than they used to, Matty knows, but that doesnt mean the glass ceiling is the stuff of history. Still, at last the opportunity is hers, and shes determined to shine. Matty is savvy, brave, and, more than most, well-informed about her business. Unfortunately, there are hidden factors at work at Justice Peak, where obsession and perverted fantasizing easily lead to murder and arson. Camouflaged by his position as a trusted member of Mattys staff, a dangerously clever sociopath plots revenge for crimes that never happened. And there are other factorsless bizarre, but no less complicating. Mattys young and headstrong firefighter son is at Justice Peak, too, and chafing under his mom\\'s command until the fire breaks loose, becoming a rampaging enemy, killing with all the brutal efficiency of a sneak attack. Did it really have inside help? Matty commits herself to finding out. A bit heavy on the job-related lore, but fine storytelling. After three creditable Lee Squires novels (A Small Target, 1996, etc.), Andreae takes a giant step forward with her appealing smoke eater: tenderhearted and womanly, tough-fibered and competitive.  -- Copyright 2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The last crews had been demobed, I had folded up our tent, the caterer did a Last Supper thing, surf and turf at three oclock in the afternoon. We happy few. We band of brothers. We were all supposed to stand up and sing Hail to Logistics. Going out I got stuck behind a U.S. West communications rig, ate its dust for twenty miles with a rubber string of langouste stuck in my top molar, hit hardtop and stopped off at the first place I came to: a dive in the middle of nowhere. Log front, broken neon sign, cabins out back under the pines, inside packed with groundpounders making up for lost time. The road was lined with vehicles on both sides.She was with a hotshot crew, four or five of them, in red T-shirts. Red with a dragon that looked like a squirrel on the back. If every other jerk in this business thinks hes got the Great American Novel waiting up his ass, every tenth jerk thinks hes some kind of Rembrandt. She wasnt wearing the artwork. She was wearing a sleeveless undershirt and no bra. You could tell right off she was no groupie. The undershirt was white cotton with tiny little ribs in it and on the back it was stained pink where shed taken a hit from retardant. You could see it made her cocky, not that she didnt have the right. Her Nomex jeans were baggy, bunched around her waist with a web belt, like, dont give me no shit, bud. Her body had a hard little strut to it. She had the shirt stretched down into her jeans and the front of it was wet, and so was her hair, one of her pals had slopped beer all over her, and you could see her nipples, small and dark through the wet white cotton. Her tits were nothing to write home about, but she acted like they were. Her eyes were beer-blurry, someone said theyd been demobed that morning.Well, I got in there at eighteen hundred. I lost count of the beers, but after a while, the place began to thin out. She stayed. She did an arm-wrestling number at the end of the bar with a college kid from Minnesota. You could see tufts of dark hair under her arms. She won. She was stronger than she looked and the kid was slobbering. He passed out and she came over and took the stool next to me. Hey, she said, her voice slightly hoarse.Hey, I said back. I lifted my bottle. Join me?Who are you? she said. She squinted, then said, Dont tell me. Youre a camp slug.I raised an eyebrow. I wasnt wearing anything she could ID. No badge, no cap, Id changed into a polo shirt. I hadnt bothered to change out of the olive-drab jeans, but there was no way she could have known I was overhead.She reached over and with two firm fingers drew a slow line along the top of my thigh. Your Nomex is unsullied, she said. Diction like a queen. You like it, dont you? she said.Im thinking, oh shit. Like what? I said, casual.Wearing your Nomex. She grinned and the sinking feeling stopped, just was gone, and then, Christ! I felt a stab, a joltlike long time no feel! I couldnt believe it!She looks at me amused and cocky at the same time, like she knows exactly whats happening with me.You like fire, she says.I respect fire, I tell her.Hey, we all got respect for the Dragon, she says. But with you its more than that. With you, its different.You can tell.I can tell, she says. Im a witch.As in Wicked Witch of the West?She corrects me: As in Fire Witch.Im wondering how drunk she is, how reliable my resurrection is. I ask her if she wants a beer. She says she doesnt think so. I drain mine and put the empty on the bartop between us. I say, You got a name, Fire Witch?Cat.Sounds familiar. Not wonderful, but she gets it. She peers at me, checking to see if it was intentional. So to speak, I say.She laughs, then chokes and coughs up black shit into a blue Kleenex. She looks at it. Fucking smoke. Then she laughs again.I was feeling dry. I nod at the bartender and he plunks down another cold brown bottle streaming icy water. I close my hand around it and she touches me again, presses two fingers just above my knee, presses hard. Dont drink it, she says and she pulls a book of matches out of her jeans, holds them up like a magician about to perform. Im still feeling where she pressed her fingers into my knee. She swivels around so the bartenders at her back, straightens her spine, opens up her knees, there I am, sitting pretty.Watch, she says. She lights a match, meets my eyes and moves the flame under her chin. Yellow light flickering on her throat. She stretches her neck like a dancer, then elegantly draws the match down and circles her right breast with it. She holds it against her nipple, smiles, then with a quick flourish, shakes out the flame, drops the match in my fucking beer. She flashes the book of matches at me.How about you light the next one? she says.I got the key to one of the cabins from the bartender. I ask him how much.No charge, he says. You guys worked hard, you deserve a good nights sleep. He winks. Jesus! I was so turned on, I was embarrassed to walk to the door. Outside, it was still light, only eight oclock, and the acrid smell of ash, pushed down the mountain by cooling air, hung over the cabins. There was one narrow little window over the bed. Abracadabra time. We went through her book of matches, shiny maroon cover, from a bar off Higgins Avenue. Small world, she was from Missoula too, but the coincidence wasnt a big deal, it just felt normal, like it was meant to be and I dont mean like in some cheap little song. It was as if something had shifted and we were moving on another plane of existence, everything was meshing, it all worked, I had this clarity. Margarets inept fumblings, her pathetic attempts, all that discreet maneuvering to get me to see someone, it didnt matter, none of it mattered at all. Tires crunched outside on the gravel and she worked her magic. She was a witch! I was six years old and forty-six at the same time. We ran out of matches and I had to get dressed and go back to the bar and bum a pack off the locals who were celebrating their pathetic windfalls, some guy with a dozer making megabucks off us, another bragging about three thousand ham sandwiches hed sold us at five bucks each.Matches worked best. We tried her Bic, yellow mini number she had, disposable, but it wasnt the same. Matches06 June 10:04p Directory C:\\\\*.*Shit. Margaret came in. I exited so fast I almost lost this.

Here I am sinking in shit and Margaret comes in and puts her hand on my shoulder. What are you working on, hon?Go to bed, I tell her, Ill be up in a bit. She wouldnt leave. Maybe her estrogen was kicking in. What, I say, you want me to come up and diddle you?She didnt. Where was I? Matches. Strips of cardboard dipped in sulfur. They consume themselves, a one-of-a-kind event that leaves only a residue of ash. Matches equalize. Both the one worshiped and the worshiper feel the sting of flame. The match releases its wave of heat, the flame bites her skin, my fingers. Were connected by a line of fire, a sacred radius. The radius may move, like the needle of a compass, but its indelible. She is still connected to me. She doesnt know it, but she is.We drew a magic circle. A square in a circle, futon on the floor under the windows. The floor had just been refinished after the last tenant, so we put mayonnaise lids under the candles. A magic circle of fire. We had two whole days together, candles burning the whole time. Shit came out that Id forgotten. We were both crying. Youre healing, she said. She sucked on a jay, sucked on me. Youre incredible, she said. You really are a fire god.07 June 8:45a Directory C:\\\\*.*Never made it upstairs last night. Crashed in the den, woke up on the carpetno hangover!

In this good-humored yet careful examination of mainstream print advertisements and bra-industry publications such as the Corset and Underwear Review, Farrell-Beck, a professor of textiles and clothing at Iowa State University\\'s College of Family and Consumer Sciences, and Gau, president of a home-based textile-conservation business, illuminate women\\'s experience of this most everyday, functional yet still titillating and even scandalous garment. Less a history of the bra than a study of its relationship to history, the book traces public perception of the bra\\'s foremost function: originally conceived as a garment meant to promote women\\'s health, it came to be seen as one meant to improve their appearance. Bra design, the authors demonstrate, shifted endlessly in response to such factors as wartime rationing, the increasing number of women in sports and, of course, the feminist movement of the 1960s and \\'70s. Many of Farrell-Beck and Gau\\'s discoveries are surprising: Who knew that the U.S. government commissioned Maidenform to design a vest for carrier pigeons during WWII or that one enterprising manufacturer marketed a bra with a tiny, zippered pocket intended to hold money?

If the essay has a theme, it is that many Greeks saw Eros as a sense of lack that fruitfully combined both pain and pleasure. This thesis is not new, but the author's style is, combining subtle interpretation with a sometimes startling poetic sensitivity. The result leaves one wondering about the intended audience. The general public may find its textual emphasis and frequently elusive tone an obstacle, while specialists may question the validity of various exegesesor of this theory of Eros, which is only one of many.

This book provides the nation with a rich detailed lived history, which did not begin with September 11, 2001. It is an excellent compilation of events, reports and lived experiences. This documented collection of story will give readers a new chance to fill in the gaps within a historical context that Arabs and Muslims Americans have lived in. In the wake of the events of 9/11, since the tears flooded our faces, we have been forced to recount the events that created the bias and hostility toward Muslims, Arabs, and Islam. This book is a must read for those who are willing to consider the possibility that Arab and Muslim Americans should not become the scapegoats for the world''s disharmony. Dr. Sima Imam, Professor of Education at National Louis University, Illinois, and President of American Muslim Civil Rights.The increasing public's curiosity about the Arabs, Muslims and the Arab and Muslim Americans in the United States has been unprecedented. This book explains the phenomenon of stereotypes stigmatizing Arabs and Muslims, and how it has affected their lives, a phenomenon that demonized and dehumanized almost two billion people in this world.\\tMore than nine years have passed marking the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on our nation, yet we are still recuperating from the shock that this tragic event has caused us, as a society. The American people are still trying to make sense of what happened. Meanwhile, the publics interest to learn about Arabs and Muslims, in general, and Arab and Muslim Americans, in particular, has been unprecedented. The nation has been looking for means of self-healing and reconciliation.To many Arab and Muslim Americans (about three million Arab-Americans and seven million Muslim-Americans), 9-11 also represented a turning point in how America is struggling to accept them as a community with a distinct religious identity. The wave of anti-Muslim hate crimes after 9-11 was the worst in the nations history. Although it has tapered off since the early weeks of the crisis, anti-Muslim agitation in television and radio has contributed to unprecedented acts of hate crimes.Islam and Muslims became a matter of public discourse in America. Along with major media organizations, mainline Protestants and Catholics, as well as members from the Black, Latino, Asian and Jewish communities have favored a position that distinguishes between extremists and mainstream Muslims.\\tVery few books have tried to answer the questions: Who are the Arabs? Who are the Muslims? Who are the Arab Americans? The Stereotypes around Arabs, and how did they evolve? Arab and Muslims in the United States: Where do they live and how many are them? Do Arabs have a shared religion? When did Arab people come to the United States? Are Arabs a minority group? Are Arab Americans more closely tied to their country of origin, or to America? Arab Contributions to Civilization, if there is any? Are Arab Americans active in U.S. politics? Have Arab Americans won major political offices? Who are some prominent Arab-American politicians? Nevertheless, no books that deal with the plight of Arab and Muslim Americans after 9/11 have been published yet.This book tries to answer the many questions that a great number of people are trying to find answers for. The increasing publics curiosity about the Arabs, Muslims and the Arab and Muslim Americans in the United States has been unprecedented. The book also explains the phenomenon of stereotypes stigmatizing Arabs and Muslims, and how it has affected their lives, a phenomenon that demonized and dehumanized almost a billion and half people in this world.\\tAladdin Elaasar is a journalist, educator, poet, short-story writer, public speaker, cross-cultural and media consultant whose writings have been published in several newspapers in the USA and overseas, in both English and Arabic.

Processor: A lower-end cousin to AMD's XP processor line, the 1.8 GHz AMD Sempron 3000+ found in this notebook is compatible in speed with Intel's 2.4 GHz Celeron processor. It's speedy enough for everyday computing needs and running office productivity software, but won't be quite enough for higher-end video editing or 3D gaming. This processor features AMD's Cool'n'Quiet Technology, which conserves power while also keeping the notebook's decibels to a minimum. It also features up to a 1600 MHz front-side bus (FSB) and a 128 KB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system's performance.) Memory: The 512 MB of built-in memory (DDR SDRAM) is fine for basic productivity and multimedia software, and it offers what's becoming an average RAM speed (333 MHz). It has two memory slots in total, with a maximum memory expansion up to 1 GB (2 x 512 MB), which is a bit small in comparison to other notebooks in this line. CD/DVD Drive: Offering the latest in DVD writing technology, this multiformat DVD/CD drive is compatible with both DVD+ and DVD- disc formats as well as dual-layer (DL) DVD+R discs, which can store up to 8.5 GB of data. It features 16x DVD+R, 8x DVD-R, 4x DVD+/-RW, 2.4x DVD+R DL, 16x DVD-ROM, 40x CDR, 24x CD-RW, and 40x CD-ROM ROM speeds. Keyboard  Mouse: This notebook has a 101-key keyboard and a touchpad with on/off button and dedicated vertical/horizontal Scroll Up/Down pad.  Screen, Graphics and Sound This notebook features a 15-inch XGA TFT Brightview display (1024 x 768-pixel resolution), which provides improved viewing in direct sunlight. Video is powered by the ATI Radeon XPress 200M IGP video/graphics card, which delivers good, though not high-end, 3D graphics. It delivers up to 128 MB of video RAM shared with the system RAM. ATI's HyperMemory technology allows the chipset to run in either Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) mode or with dedicated frame buffer memory to enhance graphics performance.  Connectivity and Expansion Slots The ze2315us has an integrated 54g wireless LAN that's fully compatible with 802.11b/g wireless networks.

The book\\'s sympathies are clearly on the side of the Sandinistas. Galeano ( Century of the Wind ) sets the tone by decrying the ``despoilment of the world\\'\\' by the U.S. government, with its ``criminal system\\'\\' of ``financial extortion.\\'\\' The Uruguayan writer extols the Sandinistas\\' socialist system and calls the election of the U.S.-backed Chamorro ``a blow like hatred from God.\\'\\' Many of the black-and-white duotones that follow are affecting, although few capture the revolutionary spirit to which Galeano so thoughtfully gives voice. Among the most meaningful pictures are those of a wounded Sandinista soldier lying in a hospital bed, his open shirt exposing a foot-long suture down his stomach; children enjoying a respite from the strife around them as they rehearse for a Maypole (sic) festival; Nicaraguan women, looking as if nothing was amiss, drinking beer at a U.S. Embassy party; and a murdered peasant, with a large hole in his head.

The 135 black-and-white photos--the work of 47 photographers--are supplemented by brief texts by Jenkins and three introductory pieces by Latin American literary figure Eduardo Galeano. The work is openly sympathetic to the Sandinistas.

       " 'B000I5YD8C': 'Josh King: Vocals, Guitar David McLaughlin: Guitar Joel Kiser: Guitar  Matt Bowers: Keyboards Jeff Linn: Bass Phil Bell: Drums Given tastemakers\\' habit of focusing on \"the next big thing\" from either  coast, North Carolina may seem an unlikely breeding ground for musical  genius. But when you look back at the legends who\\'ve come from NC--from Ben  Folds to Ryan Adams, Thelonious Monk to Superchunk--you realize how  head-slappingly obvious it is. More than \"something in the water,\" there\\'s  something in the spirit of North Carolina that fosters pure, uninhibited  musical ingenuity. And with Greensboro\\'s House Of Fools, NC adds yet  another chapter to its legacy. Rock-solid and subtly infectious, House Of Fools\\' self-titled Drive-Thru  Records debut proves what a dynamic powerhouse the band is in the studio.  But as anyone who\\'s heard these songs at shows over the past year will tell  you, the EP also confirms House Of Fools\\' reputation as a monster live act.  From the piano strains and guitar-god heroics of the concert staple \"Live  And Learn\" to the cascading acoustic beauty of \"Better Part Of Me\"  (featuring The Wallflowers\\' Rami Jaffee on accordion and organ), the five  songs on House Of Fools sound fleshed-out and intimate mostly because they  had a chance to evolve in concert first. \"When we get in the studio, it  really forces us to get our ideas together and focus on the moment,\" says  singer/guitarist Josh King. \"Live, we tend to be a lot looser, and a lot of  times we find that\\'s where our best ideas come from.\" It was a much different story just two years ago, when, playing in the  well-regarded rock/punk group The Necessary, King, guitarists David  McLaughlin and Joel Kiser, and bassist Jeff Linn found themselves feeling  boxed in by the more straightforward nature of their sound. \"We all liked  what we were doing in the Necessary; that was the sort of music we grew up  on,\" McLaughlin remembers, \"But as we got older and our musical tastes  started evolving, it wasn\\'t the only music we were listening to anymore.\" The music they were listening to--a sonic melting pot that included  everything from \\'80s guitar-rock wizardry to classic singer-songwriter  ballads--crystallized in the form of a 2004 demo recorded by King and  future HOF keyboardist Matt Bowers. \"These were basically just songs that I  recorded for fun, just so I could document them and get them out there,\"  King remembers. Ironically, though he had no big aspirations for the music  beyond the simple joy of making it, King saw his demos catching Drive-Thru  Records\\' attention--and following the addition of Phil Bell on drums, House  Of Fools quickly evolved from demo project to full-scale band. Making their official recorded debut on Drive-Thru\\'s 2005 compilation  Listen To Bob Dylan: A Tribute with a cover of \"Blowin\\' In The Wind,\" House  Of Fools hit the studio that summer with producer Walt Vincent (The Format,  Pete Yorn) to lay down tracks for their first proper Drive-Thru release.  And as House Of Fools proves, freewheelin\\' folk-rock is just one of the  classic styles that inform the band\\'s sound. The band\\'s triple-guitar  attack, packed with harmony leads and huge volume swells, puts HOF in  league with Southern-rock giants, while their lush keyboards and rich  orchestrations add a simultaneously modern and timeless feel that finds  previously unexplored links between Queen and Elliott Smith. \"What gives  [the EP] this cool kind of weirdness is that we all have similar and  totally different influences at the same time,\" McLaughlin explains. \"But  the great thing is that we can all appreciate each other\\'s differences.\"  Over the past year, shows with Limbeck, Daphne Loves Derby, Hellogoodbye,  Steel Train, and other eclectic kindred spirits have only cemented House Of  Fools\\' reputation as a scorching live act. Shortly after catching their  breakout set at the 2006 South By Southwest music conference in Austin,  Texas, Alternative Press magazine proclaimed HOF one of \"100 Bands You Need  To Know In 2006\" in its annual cover special. With an upcoming full-length featuring additional production from Mike  Green (Paramore, The Matches) on tap, House Of Fools have only begun to  show their potential. And even if the world may not have its eye on North  Carolina at the moment, it\\'s only a matter of time before the band shifts  people\\'s focus. \"The only thing I\\'m sure of is that we\\'ll keep evolving,\"  says Josh. \"Our next record might sound completely different than the EP;  but hopefully, to people out there who can appreciate a whole range of  music, they\\'ll see we\\'re writing this music because we enjoy it; it feels  good to us. Hopefully, people will hear it and go, `Oh, yeah - so that\\'s  what rock `n\\' roll sounds like!\\' If nothing else, they\\'ll definitely have  fun.\"\\tA little bit country, a little bit rock n\\' roll, House of  Fools\\' debut EP blends classic influences like Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and  Queen with contemporary ones like The Format and Ellitt Smith.

Dubner\\'s father died when he was relatively young, and Dubner, growing up in rural New York, latched onto Pittsburgh Steeler great Franco Harris as a role model and a source of strength. While much of the book chronicles Dubner\\'s efforts to catch up to Harris and investigate his former (and newly awakened) feelings of awe for him, it attempts to deal with much more. As Dubner explains to Harris at a Pittsburgh restaurant, \"I\\'m also interested in the whole idea of the hero, of the role model. I\\'m interested in the relationship between a hero and a hero worshiper. I\\'m interested in how a hero lives through the spotlight and what he does with his life after the spotlight has been turned off.\" The problem, it turns out, is that Franco really isn\\'t interested. He obviously prefers the relationship to be a distant one, and he\\'d much rather be tending to the affairs of his nutritional donut company than sharing insights with a starstruck writer. While Dubner\\'s repeated, failed attempts to meet up with Harris are somewhat humorous, the book suffers from Harris\\'s lack of cooperation. One can\\'t help but wonder if a chapter on hero worship that includes the 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle and the founder of the Lubavitcher sect of Hasidic Jews isn\\'t the product of Dubner digging too deeply for material.

So he decided to track down the Pittsburgh Steeler celebrity who had been immortalized in NFL lore for making the \"immaculate reception\" in 1972 so he could induce Harris to cooperate on a book elucidating the fan-sports star relationship. Dubner had the writing credentials (Turbulent Souls, 1998, about his parents\\' conversion from Judaism to Catholicism and his own vice versa) to convince Harris he wasn\\'t just another autograph hound, so Harris collected Dubner from the airport and spent a day breaking bread with him in Pittsburgh. The journalist without rapidly reverted to the infatuated adolescent within, and Dubner confessed to Harris his recurring dream of playing backyard football with him. Buoyed by his successful day and Harris\\' promise to \"work it out\" about the book, Dubner found his ecstasy and admiration dissipating when Harris proved to be as politely elusive about the book as he was on the gridiron.
